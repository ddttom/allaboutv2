                        <p>It looks into the core concepts, algorithms, and models that enable AI to process
                            information, recognise patterns, learn from data, make predictions, and execute tasks that
                            typically require human intelligence.</p>

                        <p>While guiding the world's largest AEM implementation for Nissan-Renault, I calculated that
                            our team's daily work equaled seven years of solo development—a scale that taught me the
                            true power of human collaboration.</p>
                        <p>Today, as both 'The AEM Guy' and a digital transformation expert, I'm fascinated by how AI is
                            reshaping content management while still requiring human expertise to deliver meaningful

                    <div>AI gets things wrong. We need to understand why</div>
                    <div>A Norwegian man named Arve Hjalmar Holmen asked ChatGPT about himself…</div>
                    <div><a

                    <div>
                        <p>The AI fabricated a tragic story about Arve Killing his sons.</p>
                        <p>This completely fictional narrative was presented as fact.</p>
                        <p>How do these hallucinations occur in AI systems?</p>
                        <p>Understanding the inner workings helps us use AI more wisely</p>

                    <div>Despite impressive capabilities, AI systems can generate false information with confidence
                    </div>
                    <div>Computers only work with numbers, so AI must convert language into numbers.</div>

                    <div>
                        <p>AI systems like ChatGPT can generate false information with confidence</p>
                        <p>AI relies on the input query and goes through many calculations</p>
                        <p>The calculations are hidden from the user, it just a 'black box'</p>
                        <p>By the end of this session I hope you have a better understanding of how AI works.<br><br>I
                            hope to explain this topic in a way that is easy to understand, time for questions is at the

                    <div>All of the internet plus….</div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Modern AI is trained on vast amounts of text data.</p>
                        <p>This includes books, websites, scientific papers, and more.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div><span class="icon icon-corpus"></span></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>The corpus provides patterns for the AI to learn from</p>
                        <p>But the sheer diversity means the AI must generalize</p>
                        <p>The scale of data creates challenges for quality control</p>
                    </div>

                <div>
                    <div>Building the Dictionary: Tokens and Embeddings</div>
                    <div></div>
                    <div>LLMs breaks language into basic units called "tokens"</div>
                    <div><span class="icon icon-building"></span></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Tokens can be words, parts of words, or punctuation</p>
                        <p>Each token is converted to a unique ID in a dictionary</p>
                        <p>These IDs map to "embedding vectors" - points in a high-dimensional space</p>
                        <p>Similar words have embedding vectors that are close together</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div>Token Embedding: A Closer Look</div>
                    <div></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Each token maps to a compact vector in high-dimensional space:</p>
                        <p>Example (simplified to 3 dimensions for illustration):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>"the" → [0.123, -0.456, 0.789]</code></li>
                            <li><code>"fat" → [0.234, 0.567, -0.345]</code></li>
                            <li><code>"cat" → [-0.678, 0.123, 0.456]</code></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Real embeddings use 300-700+ dimensions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>These vectors capture semantic relationships</p>
                        <p>Similar words have vectors pointing in similar directions</p>

                    <div>A Practical Example: Tokenising a Sentence</div>
                    <div>Let's examine how AI tokenises a familiar sentence</div>
                    <div>
                        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Split into tokens (some words may be divided)</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Convert to token IDs</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Convert to embedding vectors. Each ID maps to a high-dimensional
                            vector</p>

                    <div>How AI Generates Text</div>
                    <div></div>
                    <div>AI predicts the next token based on previous tokens, using a statistical sampling method</div>
                    <div><span class="icon icon-generates"></span></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>For each prediction, it calculates probabilities for all tokens</p>
                        <p>It uses sampling strategies to select the next token:</p>
                        <p>Weighted Tombola: Tokens with higher probabilities have more "tickets"</p>
                        <p>Top-K: Only consider K most likely tokens</p>
                        <p>Top-P: Include enough tokens to reach P% of total probability</p>
                        <p>Text is built token by token through this process</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>Pre-training phase: Predict the next token in the sequence.</p>
                        <p>For example: "The capital of France is ___”</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Uses gradient descent to improve predictions over time</p>
                        <p>Captures not just vocabulary but grammar, facts, reasoning<br><br>Q (Query): What each word
                            is looking for from other words. Think of it as a word asking "what information do I need?"
                        </p>
                        <p>K (Key): What each word offers to other words. Like labels showing what information each word
                            has.</p>
                        <p>V (Value): The actual content that gets passed between words. The information itself.</p>
                        <p>K^T: The transposed Key matrix. This allows each word to "see" all other words.</p>
                        <p>d_k: How many numbers are used to represent each key.</p>
                        <p>√d_k: A scaling factor that keeps numbers manageable, like turning down the volume when it
                            gets too loud.</p>
                        <p>softmax(): Turns raw numbers into percentages that add up to 100%. Highlights the important
                            connections while downplaying the unimportant ones.</p>
                        <p>V multiplication: Uses the percentages to mix together values from all words, giving more
                            weight to the important ones.</p>
                        <p>The whole formula lets each word gather information from all other words in the sentence,
                            with more attention paid to the words that matter most for understanding. This is why BERT
                            can tell if "bank" means a financial institution or a riverside in different sentences.</p>

                        <p>Hands and fingers: AI struggles to depict realistic hands, often creating extra fingers,
                            distorted shapes, or unnatural positions.</p>
                        <p>Facial features: Faces can sometimes appear asymmetrical, with misplaced eyes, crooked
                            smiles, or odd proportions.</p>
                        <p>Backgrounds: AI may generate inconsistent or illogical backgrounds, blending objects or
                            creating surreal settings unintentionally.</p>
                        <p>Lighting and shadows: Improper lighting or shadow placement can make the image look unnatural
                            and out of sync.</p>
                        <p>Text in images: When generating text as part of an image, AI often produces gibberish or
                            incomplete characters, remember it was fed with Tokens not Text</p>
