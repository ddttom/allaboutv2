## Key Concepts

### From JSON to Full Applications

The journey through modern framework integrations with Edge Delivery Services starts with vanilla JavaScript, then progresses through Vue, React, Web Components, and Adobe Spectrum. This headless approach transforms how developers think about Edge Delivery Services.

### What You Can Build

- Product catalogues with advanced filtering
- Interactive image galleries
- Data visualizations and charts
- Dashboard interfaces
- Interactive testing and documentation environments
- All while maintaining Edge Delivery Services' core performance strengths

### Architecture Philosophy

Each framework adds organization while preserving the speed that makes Edge Delivery Services compelling. The goal is to go beyond static pages and create rich, interactive experiences through thoughtful architecture and modern JavaScript techniques.

### Modern Development Workflows

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive testing and documentation in the browser
- **AI-Powered Development**: Leverage AI assistants for faster EDS block development
- **Living Documentation**: Documentation that's executable and demonstrable
- **Framework Flexibility**: Choose the right tool (React, Vue, Web Components, Spectrum) for your needs

## Implementation Details

### Converting Vanilla JavaScript to Frameworks

The next evolution involves converting vanilla JavaScript implementations to structured frameworks. Each architecture adds organization patterns while maintaining performance:

- **React**: Component-based architecture with virtual DOM
- **Vue**: Progressive framework with reactive data binding
- **Web Components**: Native browser standards for encapsulation
- **Adobe Spectrum**: Enterprise-ready design system components
- **Headless SPA**: Framework-less approach for maximum control

### Testing & Development

- **Browser-based Jupyter**: Test blocks interactively without build steps
- **VS Code Integration**: Develop and test within your IDE
- **AI Assistance**: Use Claude and other AI tools for faster development
- **Debugging Techniques**: Systematic approaches from logging to instrumentation
