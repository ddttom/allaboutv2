        "1. **Clear State, Always Visible**\n",
        "   - Make loading, success, and error states explicit\n",
        "   - Don't rely on color or animation alone\n",
        "   - Use data attributes and ARIA labels\n",

        "   - Success confirmations that don't disappear\n",
        "   - Clear indication of what happened\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Complete Information**\n",
        "   - Show full pricing upfront\n",
        "   - Avoid \"from £99\" with hidden costs\n",
        "   - Make all content accessible without pagination\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Semantic Structure**\n",
        "   - Use proper HTML elements\n",
        "   - Add JSON-LD structured data\n",
        "   - Clear heading hierarchy\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **URL-Based State**\n",
        "   - URL should reflect current state\n",
        "   - Bookmarkable, shareable\n",
        "   - Browser history works correctly"
