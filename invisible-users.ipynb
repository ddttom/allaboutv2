    "\n",
    "In late 2024, author Tom Cranstoun tried something simple: he asked an AI assistant to compare tour operators for a Southeast Asia trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI confidently reported: \"Tour Company A offers a 14-day experience covering Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. Tour Company B only covers one day in Bangkok. Company A is clearly superior.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**This was completely wrong.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Company B also had a 14-day itinerary. But they split it across 14 pages, each requiring a click on \"Next\" to view the next day. The AI agent saw Day 1, assumed that was everything, and gave useless advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom ended up booking with a different company—one that showed their entire itinerary on a single scrollable page. The agent could read it. Tom could compare it. That company got his money.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The paginated site lost a customer and will never know why.**"

    "### What Makes Users \"Invisible\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents are called \"invisible users\" for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **They're invisible to site owners** — Unless you're specifically tracking agent traffic (and most aren't), you have no idea how many agents visit your site or whether they succeed. They blend into analytics as slightly unusual sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Your interface is partly invisible to them** — They can't see your beautiful animations, don't notice subtle color changes, miss three-second toast notifications, and don't understand that a loading spinner means \"wait.\"\n",
