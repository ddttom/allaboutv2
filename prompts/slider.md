# carousel

Create a franklin image slider with images, named slider. it should behave like a carousel

the first cell in the franklin table is the table name, subsequent rows contain a url to an image.  
on loading the images randomize them
read all of the rows when creating the slider. when creating the example select 6 images at random, the slider should not have a text tile, side by side images only
it should rotate through each image every 15 seconds. provide a placement indicator. if the user hovers over the image stop rotating. when the user moves off the image start rotating again
