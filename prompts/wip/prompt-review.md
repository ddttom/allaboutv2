# Prompt Engineer Review: Showcaser Block

## Overall Summary
The showcaser prompt provides a good foundation for creating a Franklin block to display code snippets. However, it lacks specificity in some areas and could benefit from more detailed instructions on implementation and best practices.

## Major Strengths
1. Clear overall goal and key features outlined.
2. Emphasis on important aspects like error handling, customization, and accessibility.

## Areas for Improvement (in order of priority)
1. Lack of specific implementation details for JavaScript functionality
2. Insufficient guidance on accessibility implementation
3. Missing instructions for testing and validation
4. Limited information on error handling strategies
5. Absence of code style and best practices guidelines

## Detailed Recommendations

### 1. JavaScript Implementation Details
- Provide more specific instructions on how to implement the book-like interface
- Include guidance on event handling for clickable titles
- Specify how to handle the removal and re-insertion of code snippets

### 2. Accessibility Implementation
- Add specific ARIA attributes to use for different components
- Provide instructions on keyboard navigation implementation
- Include guidance on color contrast and text alternatives

### 3. Testing and Validation
- Add a section on how to test the block's functionality
- Include instructions for validating accessibility features
- Suggest tools or methods for performance testing

### 4. Error Handling Strategies
- Provide more detailed instructions on types of errors to handle
- Include examples of user-friendly error messages
- Suggest strategies for graceful degradation

### 5. Code Style and Best Practices
- Add guidelines for code formatting and naming conventions
- Include instructions on commenting and documentation standards
- Provide references to Franklin-specific best practices

## Additional Considerations
- Include instructions for creating variations of the block (e.g., different themes or layouts)
- Add guidance on internationalization and localization considerations
- Suggest performance optimization techniques for handling large numbers of code snippets
