# dam block

## AI Prompt, (c) Tom Cranstoun, September 2024, V 1.0

**Goal:** Create a Franklin block named dam that contains a list of images in the rows

The first cell in the table is the table name, subsequent rows contain a textual description in the first cell, a classification name in the second cell, a tagname in the third cell, and a picture element or an href element in the fourth cell. 

The block should display the output as a .json with description, classification, tag, and path to the image without the domain name inside a code html element, extract the path to the image and use it as an image.

## JavaScript (dam.js)

Create a `dam.js` file with the following functionality:
- Export a default `decorate` function that takes a `block` parameter
- Iterate through the block's children (rows)
- Extract data from each row: description, classification, tag, and image path
- Create a JSON object with the extracted data
- Display the JSON output in a `<pre><code>` element

## CSS (dam.css)

Create a `dam.css` file with the following styles:
- Style the `<pre>` element to ensure proper formatting of the JSON output
- Add responsive styles for different screen sizes
- Use CSS variables for theming and consistency

## Additional Requirements

- Ensure the JavaScript code follows the Airbnb style guide
- Use `async/await` for any asynchronous operations
- Include error handling for potential issues (e.g., missing image elements)
- Add comments to explain complex logic or important steps
- Optimize for performance and accessibility

Remember to create README.md and EXAMPLE.md files for the block, following the structure guidelines provided earlier.
