<p>Millions of AI agents browse your website every day. Most of them fail.</p>
<p>They can’t find your contact information. They misunderstand your pricing. They abandon forms halfway through. They recommend your competitors because they couldn’t parse what makes you different.</p>
<p><strong>This isn’t a future problem. It’s happening right now.</strong></p>
<p>Machine Experience (MX) is the practice of designing websites that work for both humans AND AI agents. It’s built on three pillars: structured data, accessibility, and explicit intent. And it’s the difference between thriving and disappearing in an AI-mediated world.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem" tabindex="-1">The Problem</h2>
<p>Your website was designed for humans with eyes, mice, and patience. AI agents have none of these.</p>
<p>When ChatGPT tries to answer “How do I contact [your company]?”, it scrapes your site looking for structured contact information. If you’ve hidden it in an image, buried it in JavaScript, or left it ambiguous, the agent guesses. Or worse—it invents.</p>
<p>When an AI shopping agent compares your product to competitors, it searches for explicit specifications, pricing, and availability. If your site requires clicking through three modal dialogs and a quiz to see a price, the agent moves on.</p>
<p><strong>Human-optimized design and AI-agent compatibility are not the same thing.</strong> Your beautiful, conversion-optimized landing page might be completely opaque to the agents making purchase decisions on behalf of millions of users.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-machine-experience" tabindex="-1">The Solution: Machine Experience</h2>
<p>Machine Experience isn’t about choosing between humans and machines. It’s about recognizing that the web now has two fundamentally different types of users—and both deserve first-class experiences.</p>
<h3 id="the-three-pillars-of-mx" tabindex="-1">The Three Pillars of MX</h3>
<p><strong>1. Structured Data</strong>
Stop making agents guess. Use <a href="http://Schema.org">Schema.org</a> markup to explicitly declare what things are: products, prices, reviews, contact information, opening hours. If a human can see it, an agent should be able to parse it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Accessibility</strong>
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance isn’t just about screen readers anymore. It’s the foundation of AI agent compatibility. Semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchies, and alt text aren’t accommodations—they’re explicit intent declarations that agents rely on.</p>
<p><strong>3. Explicit Over Implicit</strong>
State your intent clearly. Don’t rely on visual cues, hover states, or contextual inference. If something is disabled, mark it disabled. If something is required, say so. Machines don’t do subtle.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters-now" tabindex="-1">Why This Matters Now</h2>
<p>In January 2026, every major commerce platform launched AI shopping agents. By February, 40% of online purchases in early-adopter segments were being mediated by AI agents, not made by humans directly clicking “Buy Now” buttons.</p>
<p>The agents that succeed are the ones navigating MX-compliant websites. The agents that fail are the ones trying to parse sites built for human intuition.</p>
<p><strong>The question isn’t whether AI agents will become dominant web users. They already are.</strong> The question is whether your website works for them.</p>
<h2 id="who-we-are" tabindex="-1">Who We Are</h2>
<p>MX Technologies is the definitive authority on Machine Experience methodology. Founded by Tom Cranstoun—CMS expert since 2001 and author of MX-Bible—we help organizations navigate the shift from human-only to human-AND-agent web design.</p>
<p>We don’t just consult. We implement. We train. We enable. And we’ve proven that MX-compliant sites outperform on every metric that matters: SEO, accessibility scores, conversion rates, and agent recommendation frequency.</p>
<h2 id="start-your-mx-journey" tabindex="-1">Start Your MX Journey</h2>
<p>Understanding Machine Experience doesn’t require a background in AI or machine learning. It requires understanding your current users AND your emerging users. Both matter. Both deserve excellent experiences.</p>
