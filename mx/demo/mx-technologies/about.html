<p><strong>We help organizations design websites that work for both humans and AI agents.</strong></p>
<p>That’s our entire focus. Not general web development. Not generic digital transformation. Machine Experience—the methodology that makes websites understandable, parseable, and actionable for the AI agents that are rapidly becoming the primary way people interact with the web.</p>
<h2 id="the-founding-insight" tabindex="-1">The Founding Insight</h2>
<p>In 2024, Tom Cranstoun—a content management systems (CMS) expert with experience going back to 2001—noticed something troubling:</p>
<p>Companies were spending millions optimizing websites for human visitors while completely ignoring the AI agents browsing alongside them. Forms that worked perfectly for humans failed spectacularly for agents. Pricing information visible to anyone with eyes was completely opaque to machines. Contact details prominently displayed were unparseable by AI shopping assistants.</p>
<p><strong>The web was evolving. Web design wasn’t.</strong></p>
<p>That realization led to the development of Machine Experience (MX) methodology—a systematic approach to designing websites that serve all users, human and machine, without compromise.</p>
<h2 id="our-mission" tabindex="-1">Our Mission</h2>
<p><strong>Make the web work for everyone and everything that uses it.</strong></p>
<p>For 30 years, web design optimized exclusively for humans. That made sense when humans were the only users. But AI agents aren’t replacing humans—they’re joining them. And they deserve first-class experiences too.</p>
<p>MX Technologies exists to bridge that gap. To help organizations recognize that:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI agents are already here, browsing your site right now</li>
<li>Optimizing for agents doesn’t mean compromising human experience</li>
<li>The things that help agents (structure, semantics, explicitness) also help humans</li>
<li>Companies that adopt MX early build competitive moats</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe the convergence of human accessibility and AI agent compatibility isn’t coincidental—it’s fundamental. Good design serves all users, regardless of how they access your content.</p>
<h2 id="the-mx-bible" tabindex="-1">The MX-Bible</h2>
<p>In 2025, Tom published <em>MX-Bible: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else</em>, the definitive guide to Machine Experience methodology.</p>
<p>The book examines how modern web design—optimized for human users with visual browsers—systematically fails for AI agents. It provides practical guidance for developers, designers, and business stakeholders navigating the shift to agent-mediated commerce.</p>
<p><strong>Key insights from MX-Bible:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Why accessibility compliance is now the foundation of AI agent compatibility</li>
<li>How <a href="http://Schema.org">Schema.org</a> structured data transforms from nice-to-have to business-critical</li>
<li>Why explicit intent declarations matter more than visual design patterns</li>
<li>Real-world case studies of MX implementations and their business impact</li>
</ul>
<p>The book has become required reading for forward-thinking web teams recognizing that AI agents aren’t a future concern—they’re a present reality.</p>
<h2 id="our-approach" tabindex="-1">Our Approach</h2>
<p>MX Technologies doesn’t just consult. We implement, train, and enable.</p>
<h3 id="we-start-with-understanding" tabindex="-1">We Start With Understanding</h3>
<p>Before recommending solutions, we analyze your current state:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do AI agents currently interact with your site?</li>
<li>Where are they succeeding? Where are they failing?</li>
<li>What’s the gap between human-optimized and agent-compatible design?</li>
<li>What are the highest-impact changes you can make quickly?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We don’t sell generic MX packages.</strong> Every organization has different needs, different constraints, and different opportunities. We meet you where you are.</p>
<h3 id="we-prioritize-impact-over-perfection" tabindex="-1">We Prioritize Impact Over Perfection</h3>
<p>You don’t need to rebuild your entire website to benefit from MX. You need to fix the things that matter most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical user journeys (purchase flow, contact forms, key conversions)</li>
<li>High-traffic pages (homepage, top products, main services)</li>
<li>Competitive differentiators (unique features agents should know about)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We help you implement incrementally</strong>, starting with changes that deliver immediate value and building from there.</p>
<h3 id="we-transfer-knowledge" tabindex="-1">We Transfer Knowledge</h3>
<p>Our goal isn’t to make you dependent on us. It’s to make you self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Every engagement includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training for your development team on MX principles</li>
<li>Documentation of changes and why they matter</li>
<li>Tools and checklists for maintaining MX compliance</li>
<li>Frameworks for evaluating future design decisions through an MX lens</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When we’re done, your team should understand MX as well as we do.</strong></p>
<h2 id="our-track-record" tabindex="-1">Our Track Record</h2>
<p>We’ve helped organizations across industries implement Machine Experience:</p>
<p><strong>E-commerce companies</strong> achieving 40-60% increases in agent-mediated traffic and conversions.</p>
<p><strong>Service businesses</strong> appearing in AI agent recommendations where they were previously invisible.</p>
<p><strong>SaaS products</strong> shortening sales cycles as agents can confidently answer comparison questions.</p>
<p><strong>Content publishers</strong> seeing higher citation rates as AI agents correctly attribute and link to sources.</p>
<p>We don’t disclose specific client names without permission, but the pattern is consistent: <strong>MX-compliant sites outperform on every metric that matters—SEO, accessibility scores, agent recommendation frequency, and business outcomes.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-trust-us" tabindex="-1">Why Trust Us?</h2>
<h3 id="deep-industry-expertise" tabindex="-1">Deep Industry Expertise</h3>
<p>Tom Cranstoun has been building content management systems since 2001. He’s seen the web evolve through multiple paradigm shifts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static HTML → Dynamic databases</li>
<li>Desktop-only → Mobile-first</li>
<li>Human-only → Human-AND-agent</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MX isn’t a trend we jumped on. It’s the culmination of 25 years watching how humans and machines interact with content.</strong></p>
<h3 id="we-practice-what-we-preach" tabindex="-1">We Practice What We Preach</h3>
<p>This website exemplifies Machine Experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete <a href="http://Schema.org">Schema.org</a> markup on every page</li>
<li>WCAG 2.1 AA compliant throughout</li>
<li>Explicit state and intent declarations</li>
<li>Semantic HTML with proper hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Browse this site with an AI agent.</strong> Ask it questions about our services, our approach, our background. It will answer accurately because we’ve structured everything explicitly.</p>
<h3 id="were-methodology-focused-not-tool-focused" tabindex="-1">We’re Methodology-Focused, Not Tool-Focused</h3>
<p>We don’t care what CMS you use, what framework powers your site, or what hosting provider you’ve chosen. MX principles work everywhere because they’re fundamental web standards—HTML5, <a href="http://Schema.org">Schema.org</a>, WCAG.</p>
<p><strong>If you can edit HTML, you can implement MX.</strong> The methodology adapts to your stack, not the other way around.</p>
<h2 id="the-team" tabindex="-1">The Team</h2>
<h3 id="tom-cranstoun-founder-principal" tabindex="-1">Tom Cranstoun - Founder &amp; Principal</h3>
<p>CMS expert since 2001. Author of <em>MX-Bible</em>. Industry speaker on Machine Experience and AI-agent compatibility.</p>
<p>Tom’s background spans content management systems, information architecture, accessibility standards, and semantic web technologies. He recognized early that the convergence of accessibility compliance and AI agent compatibility wasn’t coincidental—it was inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> “The web is evolving from human-only to human-AND-agent. Organizations that recognize this early will dominate their categories. Those that don’t will become invisible to the agents making purchase decisions for millions of users.”</p>
<h3 id="our-network" tabindex="-1">Our Network</h3>
<p>MX Technologies collaborates with specialists across disciplines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility consultants ensuring WCAG compliance</li>
<li><a href="http://Schema.org">Schema.org</a> experts crafting structured data strategies</li>
<li>UX researchers studying human-agent interaction patterns</li>
<li>Developers implementing MX across diverse tech stacks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We bring the right expertise to your specific challenges.</strong></p>
<h2 id="our-vision" tabindex="-1">Our Vision</h2>
<p>We envision a web where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every website works reliably for both humans and AI agents</li>
<li>Accessibility and agent-compatibility are recognized as the same problem</li>
<li>Explicit, structured, semantic design is the standard, not the exception</li>
<li>Users can trust that agents accurately represent the sites they interact with</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>That web isn’t decades away. It’s being built right now, one MX-compliant site at a time.</strong></p>
<p>Organizations implementing Machine Experience today are defining the standards everyone else will follow tomorrow. They’re building recommendation advantages, SEO moats, and accessibility compliance that simultaneously serves humans and machines.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-dont-do" tabindex="-1">What We Don’t Do</h2>
<p>We’re focused specialists, not generalists. We don’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build websites from scratch (we optimize existing ones for MX)</li>
<li>Offer generic digital marketing services</li>
<li>Provide ongoing hosting or maintenance</li>
<li>Consult on general UX/UI design</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We do one thing exceptionally well: transform human-only websites into human-AND-agent experiences.</strong></p>
<p>If your needs extend beyond MX, we have trusted partners we can recommend. But when it comes to Machine Experience specifically, we’re the definitive authority.</p>
<h2 id="get-started" tabindex="-1">Get Started</h2>
<p>Whether you’re just learning about Machine Experience or ready to implement it across your organization, we can help.</p>
<p><strong>Our services include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MX Readiness Assessments (where are you now?)</li>
<li>Strategic MX Planning (where should you go?)</li>
<li>Implementation Support (how do you get there?)</li>
