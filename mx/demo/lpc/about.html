            <h2 class="text-primary">Our Story</h2>
            <p>LPC Design + Print has been serving Largs, Scotland, and beyond since 1969—over 50 years of printing excellence. What started as a traditional printing company has evolved to embrace modern design and digital services, while maintaining the personal touch and quality craftsmanship that defined our earliest days.</p>

            <p>We're a family-run business, and that means something important to us: every customer matters, every project gets our full attention, and we take pride in what we deliver. Whether you need a single business card or a thousand, we handle your job with the same care and professionalism.</p>

            <h2 class="card__title">What Makes Us Different</h2>

            <h3 class="text-primary mt-lg">No Minimum Order</h3>
            <p>Many printing companies require minimum quantities. We don't. Need just one t-shirt printed? We'll do it. One poster? No problem. This flexibility makes us the go-to choice for individuals, small businesses, and anyone who needs quality printing without the pressure of large order minimums.</p>

            <h3 class="text-primary mt-lg">50+ Years Experience</h3>
            <p>Since 1969, we've seen printing technology evolve from hot metal typesetting to digital printing and beyond. This experience means we understand not just <em>how</em> to print, but <em>what works</em>—the designs that communicate effectively, the materials that last, the finishes that impress.</p>

            <h3 class="text-primary mt-lg">Personal Service</h3>
            <p>When you work with LPC, you work directly with Scott McGregor and Stuart McGregor. No call centers, no automated systems—just real people who know your name, understand your project, and care about getting it right. Many of our customers have been with us for years, and that's no accident.</p>

            <h3 class="text-primary mt-lg">Fast Turnaround</h3>
            <p>We're known for handling rush jobs efficiently. Our customers have told us stories of 15-minute turnarounds, same-day service, and last-minute rescues. When you need it fast, we deliver—without compromising quality.</p>
