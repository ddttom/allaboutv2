# MX — Your Business, Readable by Every Machine on Earth

AI agents are reading the web and getting it wrong. A river cruise costs two thousand pounds — the agent reads two hundred and three thousand. A support article explains the fix — the agent says no fix exists. Every wrong answer wastes electricity, loses sales, erodes trust.

Machine Experience (MX) fixes this. It makes your content readable by every AI agent on earth — without making it less readable by humans. The metadata is for machines. The prose is for people. Same content, both audiences served.

## The Books

### The MX Handbook

A practical guide to adding Machine Experience to your CMS, your website, and your content workflow. Step-by-step implementations across major platforms.

**Expected publication: 2 April 2026**

### The MX Codex

The definitive reference for those implementing MX at scale. Architecture, standards, the companion web, and enterprise implementation patterns.

**Expected publication: 1 July 2026**

## The Product Family

**MX Technologies Ltd** — the company. Building the machine-readable web.

**MX Docs** — the format. Any file with structured metadata becomes a doc. Simple enough for a blog post, powerful enough for an enterprise.

More products coming soon.
