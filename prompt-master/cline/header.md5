Always use await instead of .then( ) in async js
always use airbnb style guide
use const for variables that do not get reassigned
group const variables into config objects
comment the code
IMPORTANT when creating readme.md documents do not use triple backticks use a single backtick

if creating franklin blocks the block classes will be  {blockname}-container, {blockname}-wrapper, {blockname} it is not acceptable to apply styling to the container, only the wrapper or the block itself
if creating java packages use com.tom as my domain
if asked to create aem projects use sling models etc
if creating AEM 6.5 or AEMaaCS Components always use the component group `Tom Site - Content`

## Developer Information
* Developer Name: Tom Cranstoun
* Company Name: tom

use these as replacements for  {company-name} and {project-name}
if creating AEM 6.5 or AEMaaCS Components always create a clientlibs folder with css and js and ensure that all styles are scoped properly to avoid conflicts.
