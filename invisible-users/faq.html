      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is The Invisible Users about?</h3>
        <div>
          <p><strong>The Invisible Users: Designing the Web for AI Agents and Everyone Else</strong> examines how modern web design optimised for human users fails for AI agents, and how fixing this benefits everyone. The book provides practical guidance for making websites accessible to both humans and AI agents through semantic HTML, explicit state management, and structured data.</p>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>Who should read this book?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>The book targets four primary audiences:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Professionals</strong> - developers, designers, accessibility specialists looking to future-proof their websites</li>
            <li><strong>Agent System Developers</strong> - engineers building AI agents that need to browse websites reliably</li>
            <li><strong>Business Leaders</strong> - CTOs and product owners making strategic decisions about agent-mediated commerce</li>
            <li><strong>Partners & Investors</strong> - evaluating opportunities in the emerging agent economy</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Technical Concepts</h2>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are AI agents in the context of this book?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>AI agents are autonomous software systems that browse websites on behalf of users. The book addresses a diverse ecosystem:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>CLI agents</strong> - Command-line tools running locally (e.g., Claude Code, Cline)</li>
            <li><strong>Browser automation agents</strong> - Using tools like Playwright or Selenium</li>
            <li><strong>Server-based agents</strong> - Cloud-hosted agents accessing websites remotely</li>
            <li><strong>Browser extension assistants</strong> - In-browser AI tools</li>
            <li><strong>IDE-integrated browser controls</strong> - Development environments with browser integration</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is this different from accessibility?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Whilst there's significant overlap with accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, clear structure, explicit feedback), AI agent compatibility has distinct requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Agents need explicit state attributes (data-state, data-validation-state)</li>
            <li>Structured data for machine reading (Schema.org JSON-LD)</li>
            <li>Clear feedback that persists in the DOM (not transient animations)</li>
            <li>Form field naming conventions (email, firstName, lastName vs custom names)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The book demonstrates how these patterns benefit both agents and humans, creating a universally accessible web.</p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>Are the patterns in this book standardised?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>The book carefully distinguishes between different maturity levels:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Established Standards</strong> - Schema.org, semantic HTML, ARIA (use with confidence)</li>
            <li><strong>Emerging Conventions</strong> - llms.txt from <a href="https://llmstxt.org">llmstxt.org</a> (early adoption phase)</li>
            <li><strong>Proposed Patterns</strong> - ai-* meta tags, data-agent-visible (not yet standardised)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All proposed patterns are forward-compatible and won't break if agents don't recognise them.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>How much does the Web Audit Suite cost?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>The Web Audit Suite is available as a separate purchase or professional audit service. Pricing varies based on your needs and the size of your website. Contact <a href="mailto:tom.cranstoun@gmail.com">tom.cranstoun@gmail.com</a> for detailed pricing information tailored to your specific requirements.</p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>What programming languages are the examples in?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>The book uses simple JavaScript for code examples with minimal dependencies, ensuring they're accessible to developers across all frameworks. Examples focus on fundamental patterns that work with any technology stack, from vanilla JavaScript to React, Vue, Angular, and server-rendered HTML.</p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does this work for my CMS/framework?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Yes. The patterns in this book are framework-agnostic and work with any CMS or framework including WordPress, Drupal, React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, and more. The book focuses on HTML output and browser behaviour, not specific implementation technologies. If your system generates HTML, these patterns apply.</p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Implementation is priority-based rather than time-based. Priority 1 quick wins (semantic HTML, form field naming, Schema.org) can be implemented immediately. Priority 2-4 improvements build systematically on foundations. <a href="https://allabout.network/invisible-users/web/appendix-f.html">Appendix F (Implementation Roadmap)</a> provides detailed priority-based guidance for phased rollout.</p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the difference between served and rendered HTML?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Served HTML is the static HTML sent from the server before JavaScript execution - what CLI agents and server-based agents see. Rendered HTML is the dynamic state after JavaScript runs - what browser-based agents see. Different agents operate in different modes, so the book addresses both states for universal compatibility.</p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do I need to know JavaScript?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Basic web development knowledge is helpful but not required. Many patterns involve HTML attributes and structured data that don't require JavaScript. The book explains concepts clearly with practical examples, making implementation accessible to web professionals of all backgrounds, from designers to backend developers.</p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I use these patterns with React/Vue/Angular?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Absolutely. Modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular all generate HTML as final output. The patterns apply to that HTML regardless of how it's generated. The book shows framework-agnostic patterns that work universally - add data attributes to JSX components, include Schema.org in your head section, use semantic HTML in your templates.</p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I validate my implementation?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Use the Web Audit Suite to analyse your implementation and generate detailed reports. Additionally, use Google's Structured Data Testing Tool for Schema.org validation, browser DevTools to inspect HTML attributes, and Pa11y for accessibility compliance. The book provides validation guidance in <a href="https://allabout.network/invisible-users/web/appendix-c.html">Appendix C</a> and Chapter 10.</p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the ROI of implementing these patterns?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>The field is too new for validated ROI data, but benefits include improved accessibility for all users, better SEO performance, reduced support costs through clearer error messages, and competitive advantage in agent-mediated commerce. Many patterns overlap with accessibility best practices, providing immediate user experience improvements whilst future-proofing for agent traffic.</p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <article class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I test for AI agent compatibility?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>The Web Audit Suite provides comprehensive AI agent compatibility testing through LLM suitability metrics. Test both served HTML (view page source) and rendered HTML (browser DevTools). Check for semantic structure, explicit state attributes, Schema.org data, and clear feedback. <a href="https://allabout.network/invisible-users/web/appendix-c.html">Appendix C</a> provides detailed testing procedures and validation criteria.</p>
