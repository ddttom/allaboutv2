# REGINALD COG Registry

Welcome to the REGINALD registry. This directory contains verified documentation in COG format — documents designed to be read by both humans and machines.

## What you'll find here

Each subdirectory is a publisher. Each file ending in `.cog.md` is a verified document. Open any COG and you'll find:

- **YAML frontmatter** at the top — the certificate (who published it, when, is it signed) and the governance contract (who maintains it, how it's kept accurate)
- **A human-readable narrative** in the body — the actual documentation, written in plain language

## Directory structure

```text
cogs/
  {client-id}/
    {subject}.cog.md        # The COG document (human + machine readable)
    .mx.yaml.md             # MX metadata for this client
  .mx.yaml.md               # This file
```

## How AI systems use this

An AI agent fetches a COG by URL, reads the YAML frontmatter to verify trust and governance, then uses the content to answer questions. No web scraping. No guessing. Verified answers from verified sources.

## How humans use this

Read the markdown body of any COG. It's written for you. The YAML at the top is for machines; the narrative below it is for everyone.
