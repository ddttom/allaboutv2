      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is Adobe Edge Delivery Services?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS) is a document-based content management system that represents a paradigm shift in web development. Content creators work in familiar tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Word, while the system handles the technical transformation into high-performance web pages with perfect Lighthouse scores."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How does EDS differ from traditional CMSs?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Traditional CMSs require content to fit rigid structures, while EDS adapts to how authors naturally create content. Authors use Google Docs, the system transforms documents to web pages, and code lives in GitHub with version control."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the content-first philosophy?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Content-first philosophy means authors create content naturally in tools they know, then developers build blocks that present that content beautifully. It eliminates friction between content creation and technical implementation."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I set up a new EDS project?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Create a new GitHub repository using the boilerplate template at github.com/adobe/aem-boilerplate, add fstab.yaml to define content source, install Adobe Sidekick browser extension, and preview your first page."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is fstab.yaml and how does it work?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "fstab.yaml is a file system table that defines where your content comes from, mapping folders to SharePoint or Google Drive sources. It connects your document repository to your website."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the Adobe Sidekick browser extension?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Adobe Sidekick is a browser extension that gives content authors control over the preview and publish workflow. It provides buttons to preview changes instantly, publish content to production, and reload without cache."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How does the document transformation process work?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "EDS uses a five-stage transformation process: 1) Fetch document from source, 2) Convert to HTML, 3) Apply core transformations, 4) Load and execute blocks, 5) Apply delayed functionality. This ensures perfect Lighthouse scores."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do content authors create pages in EDS?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Authors create pages by writing in Google Docs using standard formatting: headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and tables for blocks. The URL path follows the folder structure in Google Drive."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do tables define blocks in documents?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Tables are EDS's way of defining blocks. The first cell names the block, remaining cells contain content. The system transforms tables into semantic HTML divs that JavaScript can decorate with functionality."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I create block variations?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Add variation name in parentheses after block name in the first cell. Example: 'Cards (featured)' creates a cards block with the 'featured' CSS class applied, allowing different styling."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I add metadata to my pages?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Create a two-column table at the end of your document with property names in left column and values in right column. Common metadata includes Title, Description, Keywords, and Image."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a section and how do I create one?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Sections are structural containers created by three dashes (---) in your document. Each section becomes an HTML section element that can be styled independently with section metadata."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How does the icon system work?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Use :iconname: syntax in documents to insert icons. EDS automatically fetches SVG icons from /icons/ directory, making it easy to add visual elements without complex image management."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How are images handled in documents?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Images in documents are automatically optimized by EDS: converted to WebP format, resized to multiple widths, served via picture elements with responsive sizes, lazy loaded, and dimensioned to prevent layout shift."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What's the difference between preview and publish?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Preview environment (.aem.page) shows instant changes for testing, while publish environment (.aem.live or custom domain) serves production content that requires explicit publish action. This allows safe testing before going live."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do blocks work in EDS?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Blocks are fundamental building units created from tables in documents. Each block has JavaScript and CSS files in /blocks/ directory. EDS calls the decorate() function to transform the block DOM with custom functionality."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the table-to-div transformation?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "EDS converts document tables into nested div elements: each row becomes a div, each cell becomes a nested div. This provides semantic HTML structure that JavaScript can enhance and CSS can style flexibly."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I write JavaScript for blocks?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Create blockname.js in /blocks/blockname/ with a default export function decorate(block). Use vanilla JavaScript, modern ES6+ features, async/await, and fetch for data. No frameworks or TypeScript allowed."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do CSS variations work for blocks?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Variations add additional CSS classes to base block. Example: 'Cards (featured)' gets both 'cards' and 'featured' classes. Style variations with .blockname.variation selector in single CSS file."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What files are required for a block?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Required files: blockname.js (decoration logic), blockname.css (styling), README.md (documentation), example.md (usage examples). Optional: example.json or example.csv for data-driven blocks."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do autoblocks work (hero, buttons)?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Autoblocks are automatically created by EDS based on content patterns. Hero block auto-created from first section if it has image and heading. Button links styled as buttons automatically. No table required."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the E-L-D (Eager-Lazy-Delayed) loading strategy?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Three-phase loading: Eager (critical content, immediate), Lazy (below fold, when visible via Intersection Observer), Delayed (after page interactive, like analytics). This achieves perfect Lighthouse scores."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How does EDS achieve perfect Lighthouse scores?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "EDS achieves 100/100 Lighthouse scores through: minimal critical CSS/JS, E-L-D loading strategy, automatic image optimization, no render-blocking resources, optimized font loading, and instant CDN caching."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How are images automatically optimized?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "EDS transforms images to: WebP format for compression, multiple widths (2000px, 750px), responsive picture elements with srcset, lazy loading below fold, explicit dimensions to prevent layout shift."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What are Core Web Vitals and why do they matter?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Core Web Vitals are Google's user experience metrics: LCP (loading speed), FID/INP (interactivity), CLS (visual stability). They affect SEO rankings and user satisfaction. EDS optimizes all three automatically."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How does lazy loading work in EDS?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "EDS uses Intersection Observer API to detect when content enters viewport. Images, blocks, and resources below fold are loaded only when needed, improving initial page load performance."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is .helix/config and why is it important?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": ".helix/config is the central configuration file for EDS projects. It controls CDN settings, push invalidation, environment variables, and production behavior. It's in YAML format and version controlled."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I configure a custom domain (CDN)?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Add cdn configuration in .helix/config with prod key for production host. Configure DNS CNAME to point to EDS origin. Push invalidation configuration ensures cache updates when content changes."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is push invalidation?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Push invalidation automatically clears CDN cache when content is published. Configure via .helix/config with Cloudflare or Fastly settings. Ensures users always see latest content without manual cache clearing."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do preview, live, and production environments work?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Preview (.aem.page) for instant testing, Live (.aem.live) for published content, Production (custom domain) for public site. Content flows: preview → publish → live → production CDN."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is the double CDN architecture?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "EDS uses two CDN layers: Adobe-managed CDN for .aem.live domain, and optional customer CDN (Cloudflare/Fastly) for custom domain. This provides flexibility, performance, and enterprise-grade caching."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I publish changes with the Sidekick?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Open page in browser, click Sidekick extension, click Preview to see changes instantly, review and iterate, click Publish when ready. Published content goes to .aem.live and propagates to production CDN."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is query-index.json?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Automatically generated index of all pages in a folder with metadata. Used for navigation menus, blog listings, and search. Accessed at /folder/query-index.json with filtering and sorting capabilities."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I use spreadsheets with EDS?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Create Google Sheets or Excel files in content folder. Access via .json extension (sheet-name.json). Perfect for structured data, configuration, product catalogs, and data-driven content."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I set up URL redirects?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Create redirects spreadsheet in SharePoint/Google Drive with 'source' and 'destination' columns. Configure in fstab.yaml with redirects key. Supports 301/302 redirects for SEO and URL management."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What core JavaScript files does EDS use?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Core files: aem.js (formerly lib-franklin.js) provides core functionality, scripts.js for custom project logic, lazy.js for below-fold content, delayed.js for post-interactive features. All follow E-L-D loading pattern."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How does GitHub integrate with EDS?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Code lives in GitHub repository, content in SharePoint/Google Drive. Commits trigger automatic deployments. Pull requests enable code review workflow. GitHub Actions can run tests and custom workflows."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I debug EDS applications?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Essential techniques: view raw HTML with .plain.html extension, inspect network requests, add debug logging, use DOM breakpoints, check block loading status, test without cache. Compare raw vs processed HTML in DevTools."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What development requirements does EDS have?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Use vanilla JavaScript ES6+ (no TypeScript, no frameworks), pure CSS3 (no preprocessors, no CSS-in-JS), no build process required, files served directly. Optional /build/ directory for complex components."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do responsive images work (picture elements)?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "EDS generates picture elements with multiple source elements: WebP format, multiple widths via srcset, media queries for breakpoints, fallback img for older browsers. Browser selects optimal image automatically."}},
      {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is Content-Driven Development (CDD)?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "CDD is EDS methodology: start with content model (how authors create content), create test content first, then build blocks to present that content. Author needs drive development, not developer preferences."}}

              <p>EDS takes a fundamentally different approach compared to traditional content management systems:</p>
              <h3>Traditional CMS:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Dedicated authoring and publishing environments</li>
                <li>Custom interfaces authors must learn</li>
                <li>Complex deployment pipelines and build processes</li>
                <li>Framework dependencies (React, Vue, Angular)</li>
                <li>Bundling and compilation required</li>
                <li>Authors adapt to the system's structure</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Edge Delivery Services:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Authors use Google Docs or Microsoft Word directly</li>
                <li>No dedicated authoring environment needed</li>
                <li>Zero build process or pipelines</li>
                <li>Vanilla JavaScript and CSS only</li>
                <li>Instant preview for every GitHub branch</li>
                <li>System adapts to how authors naturally work</li>
                <li>Content published directly to edge servers</li>
              </ul>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>At its core, EDS embraces a content-first approach that radically simplifies the authoring process. Content creators work in familiar tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Word, while the system handles the technical transformation into structured web pages.</p>
              <h3>This philosophy enables:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Authors focus on writing</strong> - No need to learn complex CMS interfaces</li>
                <li><strong>Developers build functionality</strong> - Without disrupting content workflows</li>
                <li><strong>Parallel workflows</strong> - Both teams work simultaneously, accelerating delivery</li>
                <li><strong>Natural content creation</strong> - Authors use tools they already know</li>
                <li><strong>Clean separation</strong> - Content and code evolve independently</li>
              </ul>
              <p>As a developer working with EDS, understanding this philosophy is crucial—your job isn't to build a website from scratch, but to enhance how documents transform into web experiences.</p>

              <p>The <code>fstab.yaml</code> file is the critical configuration that connects your GitHub code repository to your content source (Google Drive or SharePoint). It defines "mountpoints" that map URL paths to content locations.</p>
              <h3>Basic Structure:</h3>
              <p><code>mountpoints:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;/: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/[FOLDER_ID]</code></p>
              <h3>What it does:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Maps root URL path (<code>/</code>) to specific Google Drive folder</li>
                <li>Tells EDS where to find content documents</li>
                <li>Can map different paths to different folders</li>
                <li>Enables content authors to work in Drive while developers work in GitHub</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Key Points:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>File must be in repository root</li>
                <li>YAML format (whitespace-sensitive)</li>
                <li>Folder must be shared with <code>helix@adobe.com</code></li>
                <li>Changes require commit to GitHub</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This configuration is what enables the separation between code (GitHub) and content (Google Drive/SharePoint) that makes EDS unique.</p>

              <p>The Adobe Sidekick is a browser extension that provides essential tools for content authors working with Edge Delivery Services. It bridges the gap between Google Docs and the live website.</p>
              <h3>Key Features:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Preview</strong> - See how your Google Doc will look as a web page before publishing</li>
                <li><strong>Publish</strong> - Push content live to production with one click</li>
                <li><strong>Unpublish</strong> - Remove content from production</li>
                <li><strong>Switch Environments</strong> - Toggle between dev, preview, and live URLs</li>
                <li><strong>Reload</strong> - Refresh preview to see latest changes</li>
                <li><strong>Config Activation</strong> - Activate <code>.helix/config</code> changes when published</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>How It Works:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Install extension in Chrome or Edge browser</li>
                <li>Open any Google Doc in your configured Drive folder</li>
                <li>Sidekick toolbar appears in browser</li>
                <li>Click "Preview" to see page on <code>.aem.page</code> domain</li>
                <li>Click "Publish" to push to <code>.aem.live</code> and production</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The Sidekick makes EDS accessible to non-technical content authors—they never need to touch GitHub or understand deployment pipelines.</p>

              <p>The document transformation is the heart of how EDS works. A Google Doc goes through five distinct stages before becoming a fully-functional web page:</p>
              <p><strong>Stage 1: Document Creation</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Author creates content in Google Docs using headings, paragraphs, images, links</li>
                <li>Tables define blocks like "Columns" or "Cards"</li>
                <li>Horizontal rules (---) create section breaks</li>
                <li>Metadata table defines page SEO properties</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Stage 2: Document to Markdown (Server-Side)</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>EDS accesses document via Google Docs API</li>
                <li>Converts document to Markdown format</li>
                <li>Tables processed as potential blocks</li>
                <li>Images extracted and stored separately</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Stage 3: Markdown to Initial HTML (Server-Side)</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Markdown converted to basic semantic HTML</li>
                <li>Metadata applied to <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section</li>
                <li>Content divided into sections</li>
                <li>Blocks identified with <code>data-block-name</code> attributes</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Stage 4: Initial HTML Delivery (Browser)</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Browser receives basic HTML</li>
                <li>Core scripts (<code>aem.js</code>, <code>scripts.js</code>) load</li>
                <li>DOM enhancement begins</li>
                <li>Blocks decorated with CSS and JavaScript</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Stage 5: Final DOM Transformation (Browser)</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Images converted to responsive <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> elements</li>
                <li>Links enhanced to styled buttons</li>
                <li>Sections wrapped with appropriate classes</li>
                <li>Block-specific JavaScript executes</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This multi-stage process allows content authors to focus on content while the system handles technical implementation.</p>

              <p>Content authors create pages in EDS using the same tools they already know: Google Docs or Microsoft Word. No special CMS training required.</p>
              <h3>Basic Content Elements:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Headings</strong> - H1 through H6 for structure</li>
                <li><strong>Paragraphs</strong> - Normal text with bold, italic, underline formatting</li>
                <li><strong>Lists</strong> - Bulleted or numbered lists</li>
                <li><strong>Images</strong> - Drag and drop images directly into document</li>
                <li><strong>Links</strong> - Standard hyperlinks to internal or external pages</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>EDS-Specific Features:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Section Breaks</strong> - Insert horizontal rule (---) to divide content into sections</li>
                <li><strong>Tables for Blocks</strong> - Create tables with block name in first cell to define components</li>
                <li><strong>Metadata Table</strong> - Special table with key-value pairs for SEO</li>
                <li><strong>Icon Syntax</strong> - Use <code>:iconname:</code> to insert SVG icons</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Workflow:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Create Google Doc in configured Drive folder</li>
                <li>Write content using standard formatting</li>
                <li>Click "Preview" in Sidekick to see web page</li>
                <li>Make changes and preview again (instant updates)</li>
                <li>Click "Publish" when ready to go live</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Authors never touch code, GitHub, or command lines—they just write in Google Docs.</p>

              <p>Tables in Google Docs are the primary mechanism for creating blocks (components) in EDS. The first cell in the table tells EDS which block to create.</p>
              <h3>Basic Structure:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>First cell contains block name (e.g., "Columns", "Cards", "Hero")</li>
                <li>Remaining cells contain the block's content</li>
                <li>Each row in the table typically represents a content item</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Example - Simple Columns Block:</h3>
              <p>Table in Google Doc:</p>
              <p><code>| Columns |<br>| Text in first column | Text in second column |</code></p>
              <p>Becomes HTML:</p>

              <h3>Table-to-Div Transformation:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Table element removed from final HTML</li>
                <li>Each table row becomes a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code></li>
                <li>Each table cell becomes a nested <code>&lt;div&gt;</code></li>
                <li>Block name becomes CSS class</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This transformation allows authors to structure complex layouts using familiar table interfaces, while developers work with clean div-based HTML.</p>

              <p>Block variations allow authors to apply different styling or behavior to blocks without requiring separate block implementations. Simply add options in parentheses after the block name.</p>
              <h3>Syntax:</h3>
              <p><code>BlockName (variation1, variation2)</code></p>
              <h3>Example:</h3>
              <p>Table in Google Doc:</p>
              <p><code>| Columns (dark, wide) |<br>| Content here | More content |</code></p>
              <p>Becomes HTML:</p>
              <p><code>&lt;div class="columns dark wide"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
              <h3>How Developers Use Variations:</h3>
              <p>CSS handles styling differences:</p>
              <p><code>.columns { display: grid; }<br>.columns.wide { max-width: 1200px; }<br>.columns.dark { background: #333; color: white; }</code></p>
              <p>JavaScript can detect variations:</p>
              <p><code>export default function decorate(block) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const isWide = block.classList.contains('wide');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const isDark = block.classList.contains('dark');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Apply appropriate logic<br>}</code></p>
              <h3>Benefits:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Authors control appearance without code changes</li>
                <li>One block codebase serves multiple use cases</li>
                <li>Variations can be combined freely</li>

              <p>Sections are logical divisions of content on a page. They allow you to apply different styling or layouts to different parts of the page.</p>
              <h3>Creating Sections:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Insert a horizontal rule (---) in your Google Doc</li>
                <li>Content before the rule becomes one section</li>
                <li>Content after the rule becomes the next section</li>
                <li>Each section gets wrapped in a <code>&lt;div class="section"&gt;</code></li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Example:</h3>
              <p>Google Doc content:</p>
              <p><code># Heading 1<br>Some content here<br>---<br># Heading 2<br>More content here</code></p>
              <p>Becomes HTML:</p>
              <p><code>&lt;div class="section"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Heading 1&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;Some content here&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;div class="section"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;Heading 2&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;More content here&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
              <h3>Why Use Sections:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Apply different background colors</li>
                <li>Control layout and spacing</li>
                <li>Enable/disable certain features per section</li>
                <li>Create visual hierarchy on the page</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The first section typically contains the hero or main heading, while subsequent sections contain body content.</p>

              <p>EDS provides an elegant system for incorporating SVG icons into content using a simple text syntax that authors can type directly.</p>
              <h3>Syntax:</h3>
              <p><code>:iconname:</code></p>
              <h3>Example:</h3>
              <p>In Google Doc: <code>:training:</code></p>
              <p>Becomes HTML: <code>&lt;span class="icon icon-training"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></p>
              <p>Final rendering: <code>&lt;img src="https://yoursite.com/icons/training.svg" alt="Training icon"&gt;</code></p>
              <h3>How It Works:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>EDS identifies text between colons during transformation</li>
                <li>Creates a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with <code>icon</code> and <code>icon-{name}</code> classes</li>
                <li>Looks for matching SVG file in <code>/icons/</code> directory</li>
                <li>Replaces span with <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag pointing to SVG</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Developer Setup:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Create <code>/icons/</code> directory at project root</li>
                <li>Add SVG files named <code>training.svg</code>, <code>warning.svg</code>, etc.</li>
                <li>Optimize SVGs for web (remove metadata)</li>
                <li>Document available icons for authors</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Benefits:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Authors use simple syntax (no HTML knowledge required)</li>
                <li>Centralized icon management</li>
                <li>Consistent implementation across site</li>
                <li>Semantic HTML with accessibility attributes</li>

              <p>EDS automatically transforms images from Google Docs into highly optimized, responsive images using modern web standards.</p>
              <h3>Author Experience:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Drag and drop images directly into Google Doc</li>
                <li>No need to worry about file size or format</li>
                <li>No manual optimization required</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Automatic Transformation:</h3>
              <p>Simple image in document becomes:</p>
              <p><code>&lt;picture&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="image.png?width=2000&format=webp" media="(min-width: 600px)"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="image.png?width=750&format=webp"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;source type="image/png" srcset="image.png?width=2000&format=png" media="(min-width: 600px)"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;img loading="lazy" alt="Description" src="image.png?width=750" width="1600" height="400"&gt;<br>&lt;/picture&gt;</code></p>
              <h3>Automatic Features:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Multiple Sizes</strong> - 750px for mobile, 2000px for desktop</li>
                <li><strong>WebP Format</strong> - Modern format with smaller file sizes</li>
                <li><strong>Fallbacks</strong> - PNG/JPEG for browsers without WebP</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive</strong> - Media queries select appropriate size</li>
                <li><strong>Lazy Loading</strong> - Images below fold load on demand</li>
                <li><strong>Eager Loading</strong> - Hero images load immediately</li>
                <li><strong>Dimensions</strong> - Width and height prevent layout shift</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This sophisticated optimization happens automatically—authors just insert images, and EDS handles the rest.</p>

                <li><strong>URL:</strong> <code>branch--repo--owner.aem.live</code> or custom domain</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Production content for public</li>

              <p>Blocks are the fundamental building units for custom functionality in EDS. They allow documents to include specialized components and layouts while maintaining the content-first philosophy.</p>
              <h3>How Blocks Are Created:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Authors create blocks using tables in Google Docs</li>
                <li>First cell defines the block type (e.g., "Columns", "Cards")</li>
                <li>Remaining cells contain block content</li>
                <li>System transforms table to semantic HTML divs</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Block File Structure:</h3>
              <p>Each block lives in its own directory:</p>
              <p><code>/blocks/blockname/<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;blockname.js&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Core functionality<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;blockname.css&nbsp;&nbsp;// Styling<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;README.md&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Documentation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;example.md&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Usage examples</code></p>
              <h3>Basic Block Implementation:</h3>
              <p><code>export default function decorate(block) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Transform the block DOM as needed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// 'block' is a DOM element with class 'blockname'<br>}</code></p>
              <p>EDS calls the <code>decorate()</code> function automatically when it encounters your block, passing the block's DOM element. Your code can then transform it as needed—adding interactivity, fetching data, or reorganizing content.</p>

              <p>One of the most important transformations in EDS involves how tables from Google Docs are converted into HTML div elements. Understanding this is crucial for block development.</p>
              <h3>Transformation Process:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Author creates table in Google Doc</li>
                <li>EDS identifies and parses the table</li>
                <li>Table structure converted to nested divs</li>
                <li>Each row becomes a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code></li>
                <li>Each cell becomes a nested <code>&lt;div&gt;</code></li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Example:</h3>
              <p>Google Doc table:</p>
              <p><code>| Block Name |<br>| Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Cell 3 |<br>| Cell 4 | Cell 5 | Cell 6 |</code></p>
              <p>Becomes HTML:</p>
              <p><code>&lt;div class="block-name"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;Cell 1&lt;/div&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;Cell 2&lt;/div&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;Cell 3&lt;/div&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;Cell 4&lt;/div&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;Cell 5&lt;/div&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;Cell 6&lt;/div&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
              <h3>Working with Transformed Content:</h3>
              <p><code>export default function decorate(block) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const rows = block.children;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let i = 0; i &lt; rows.length; i++) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const cells = rows[i].children;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Process each cell<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}</code></p>

              <p>EDS blocks follow specific JavaScript patterns for consistency and maintainability.</p>
              <h3>Required Structure:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Configuration Object</strong> - Define all constants at top</li>
                <li><strong>Main decorate Function</strong> - Default export that transforms block</li>
                <li><strong>Helper Functions</strong> - Utility functions below main function</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Template:</h3>
              <p><code>// Configuration<br>const BLOCKNAME_CONFIG = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;ERROR_MESSAGE: 'Error loading content',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;API_URL: '/data/content.json',<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;THRESHOLD: 10,<br>};<br><br>// Main decoration function<br>export default async function decorate(block) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;try {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Clear initial content<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;block.textContent = '';<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Fetch data if needed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const data = await fetchData();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Build content<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const content = buildContent(data);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;block.appendChild(content);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;} catch (error) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;block.textContent = BLOCKNAME_CONFIG.ERROR_MESSAGE;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}<br><br>// Helper functions<br>async function fetchData() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const response = await fetch(BLOCKNAME_CONFIG.API_URL);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return response.json();<br>}</code></p>
              <h3>Key Principles:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Use async/await (never <code>.then()</code>)</li>
                <li>Include error handling with try/catch</li>
                <li>No inline CSS—use CSS files</li>
                <li>Use vanilla JavaScript—no frameworks</li>
                <li>Keep imports minimal</li>

              <p>CSS variations provide a powerful way to create multiple visual styles for a single block without writing separate implementations.</p>
              <h3>How Variations Are Applied:</h3>
              <p>When authors write <code>BlockName (dark, wide)</code> in Google Docs, EDS adds those as CSS classes:</p>
              <p><code>&lt;div class="blockname dark wide"&gt;</code></p>
              <h3>CSS Structure:</h3>
              <p><code>/* Base styles */<br>.columns {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;display: grid;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;gap: 20px;<br>}<br><br>/* Variation: wide */<br>.columns.wide {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 1200px;<br>}<br><br>/* Variation: dark */<br>.columns.dark {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #333;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;color: white;<br>}<br><br>/* Combined variations */<br>.columns.dark.wide {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 1px solid #555;<br>}</code></p>
              <h3>JavaScript Detection:</h3>
              <p><code>export default function decorate(block) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const isDark = block.classList.contains('dark');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const isWide = block.classList.contains('wide');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if (isDark) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Apply dark-specific logic<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}</code></p>
              <h3>Benefits:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>One codebase for multiple styles</li>
                <li>Authors control appearance</li>
                <li>Variations can be combined freely</li>
                <li>No code changes needed for new variations</li>

              <h3>File Purposes:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>blockname.js</strong> - Contains <code>decorate()</code> function and logic</li>
                <li><strong>blockname.css</strong> - Block-specific styling with CSS variables</li>

              <p>Autoblocking is EDS's system for automatically applying styling and structure to common content patterns without requiring authors to create explicit blocks.</p>
              <h3>How Autoblocking Works:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>System recognizes common content patterns</li>
                <li>Automatically transforms them into blocks</li>
                <li>Applies consistent styling without author intervention</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Common Autoblocks:</h3>
              <h4>1. Hero Block</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> Image followed by heading at document start</li>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> Automatically creates hero block</li>
                <li><strong>No table needed:</strong> EDS detects the pattern</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>2. Button Enhancement</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> Links in standalone paragraphs</li>
                <li><strong>Result:</strong> Converted to styled buttons</li>
                <li><strong>Classes added:</strong> <code>button</code>, <code>primary</code>, <code>button-container</code></li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Implementation in scripts.js:</h3>
              <p><code>function buildAutoBlocks(main) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const h1 = main.querySelector('h1');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const picture = main.querySelector('picture');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// If picture precedes h1, create hero<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;if (h1 && picture && <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;picture.compareDocumentPosition(h1) === 4) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const section = document.createElement('div');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;section.append(buildBlock('hero', <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ elems: [picture, h1] }));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;main.prepend(section);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}</code></p>
              <h3>Benefits:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Authors write naturally without learning block syntax</li>
                <li>Consistent styling across site</li>
                <li>Rich web experience with minimal table usage</li>

              <p>E-L-D (Eager-Lazy-Delayed) is EDS's sophisticated three-phase loading strategy that's key to achieving perfect Core Web Vitals scores (100/100/100/100).</p>
              <h3>Phase E (Eager):</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Load critical content for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</li>
                <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Begins immediately on page load</li>
                <li><strong>Components:</strong> First section (typically hero), main heading, hero image, critical CSS (<code>styles.css</code>), core scripts (<code>aem.js</code>, <code>scripts.js</code>)</li>
                <li><strong>Target:</strong> Keep payload before LCP below 100KB</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Phase L (Lazy):</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Load important but non-critical elements</li>
                <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> After first section loads</li>
                <li><strong>Components:</strong> Remaining sections, header and footer, non-critical CSS (<code>lazy-styles.css</code>), below-the-fold images, additional fonts</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Phase D (Delayed):</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Handle lowest-priority elements</li>
                <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> After 3-second delay</li>
                <li><strong>Components:</strong> Analytics, third-party scripts, marketing tools, social widgets, chat functionality, anything in <code>delayed.js</code></li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Implementation:</h3>
              <p><code>// In scripts.js<br>async function loadEager(doc) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Load first section only<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;await loadSection(main.querySelector('.section'));<br>}<br><br>async function loadLazy(doc) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Load remaining sections<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;await loadSections(main);<br>}<br><br>function loadDelayed() {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// 3-second delay before loading<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;setTimeout(() => import('./delayed.js'), 3000);<br>}</code></p>

              <h3>Key Strategies:</h3>
              <h4>1. No Build Process</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Vanilla JavaScript—no framework overhead</li>
                <li>Pure CSS—no preprocessing</li>
                <li>No bundling or compilation delays</li>
                <li>Smaller file sizes</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>2. E-L-D Loading Pattern</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Critical content loads first (Eager)</li>
                <li>Below-fold content loads after (Lazy)</li>
                <li>Analytics delayed 3+ seconds (Delayed)</li>
                <li>Optimizes LCP and FID metrics</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>3. Automatic Image Optimization</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Multiple sizes generated (750px, 2000px)</li>
                <li>WebP format with fallbacks</li>
                <li>Responsive picture elements</li>
                <li>Lazy loading below fold</li>
                <li>Eager loading for hero images</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>4. Minimal JavaScript Execution</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Only load JS needed for visible content</li>
                <li>Blocks load on-demand</li>
                <li>No large framework parsing</li>
                <li>Efficient DOM manipulation</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>5. CSS Optimization</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Critical CSS inline in HTML head</li>
                <li>Non-critical CSS lazy loaded</li>
                <li>No unused CSS</li>
                <li>CSS variables for theming</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>6. Edge Delivery</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Content served from CDN edge locations</li>
                <li>Minimal server processing</li>
                <li>Fast TTFB (Time to First Byte)</li>

                <li><strong>Responsive Selection</strong> - Browser picks appropriate size</li>
                <li><strong>Lazy Loading</strong> - Below-fold images load on scroll</li>
                <li><strong>Eager Loading</strong> - Hero images load immediately</li>
                <li><strong>Dimensions</strong> - Width/height prevent layout shift (CLS)</li>
                <li><strong>Query Parameters</strong> - Size and format in URL</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Loading Strategy:</h3>

              <p>Core Web Vitals are Google's metrics for measuring user experience on web pages. EDS is architected to excel at all three metrics.</p>
              <h3>The Three Metrics:</h3>
              <h4>1. LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Measures:</strong> Time until largest content element renders</li>
                <li><strong>Good:</strong> Under 2.5 seconds</li>
                <li><strong>EDS Strategy:</strong> Eager loading of first section and hero image</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>2. FID (First Input Delay) / INP (Interaction to Next Paint)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Measures:</strong> Time from user interaction to browser response</li>
                <li><strong>Good:</strong> Under 100ms (FID) or 200ms (INP)</li>
                <li><strong>EDS Strategy:</strong> Minimal JavaScript execution, no framework overhead</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>3. CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Measures:</strong> Visual stability during page load</li>
                <li><strong>Good:</strong> Under 0.1</li>
                <li><strong>EDS Strategy:</strong> Image dimensions set, no late-loading elements that push content</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Why They Matter:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Google uses Core Web Vitals as ranking factors</li>
                <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Faster sites have higher engagement</li>
                <li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Better performance = more conversions</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Fast sites benefit all users, especially those on slow connections</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>EDS Advantage:</h3>
              <p>EDS sites consistently achieve 100/100/100/100 Lighthouse scores across all categories because the architecture prioritizes performance from the ground up.</p>

              <p>Lazy loading in EDS applies to both content sections and images, ensuring optimal performance by loading resources only when needed.</p>
              <h3>Section Lazy Loading:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Eager Phase</strong> - First section loads immediately</li>
                <li><strong>Lazy Phase</strong> - Remaining sections load after first section completes</li>
                <li><strong>On-Demand</strong> - Blocks within sections load as they're encountered</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Image Lazy Loading:</h3>
              <p><code>// Above-the-fold (hero)<br>&lt;img loading="eager" src="hero.jpg"&gt;<br><br>// Below-the-fold<br>&lt;img loading="lazy" src="content.jpg"&gt;</code></p>
              <h3>Implementation in scripts.js:</h3>
              <p><code>async function loadLazy(doc) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const main = doc.querySelector('main');<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Load all remaining sections<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;await loadSections(main);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Load header and footer<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;loadHeader(doc.querySelector('header'));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;loadFooter(doc.querySelector('footer'));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;// Load non-critical CSS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;loadCSS('/styles/lazy-styles.css');<br>}</code></p>
              <h3>Benefits:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Faster Initial Load</strong> - Only critical content loads first</li>
                <li><strong>Better LCP</strong> - Largest content paints quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Data Usage</strong> - Below-fold content may never load if user doesn't scroll</li>
                <li><strong>Improved TTI</strong> - Page becomes interactive faster</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Native Browser Support:</h3>
              <p>EDS uses native <code>loading="lazy"</code> attribute—no custom JavaScript intersection observers needed for images.</p>

              <p>The <code>.helix/config</code> file is the central configuration for EDS projects, controlling CDN integration, push invalidation, and environment setup.</p>
              <h3>What it controls:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>CDN integration and routing</li>
                <li>Push invalidation setup</li>

              <p>Setting up a custom domain with EDS involves configuring your CDN (typically Cloudflare) to proxy requests to Adobe's EDS infrastructure.</p>
              <h3>Setup Steps:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Add Domain to CDN</strong> - Sign up for Cloudflare (or other CDN) and add your domain</li>
                <li><strong>Update DNS</strong> - Point your domain to CDN nameservers</li>
                <li><strong>Configure .helix/config:</strong> <p><code>cdn.prod.type = cloudflare<br>cdn.prod.host = yourdomain.com<br>cdn.prod.route = /<br>cdn.live.host = main--repo--owner.aem.live</code></p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Set up CDN Worker</strong> - Configure worker to proxy to EDS:
                  <p><code>// Cloudflare Worker<br>const EDS_HOST = 'main--repo--owner.aem.live';<br><br>async function handleRequest(request) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;const url = new URL(request.url);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;url.hostname = EDS_HOST;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return fetch(url, request);<br>}</code></p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Publish Config</strong> - Use Sidekick to activate configuration</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Architecture:</h3>
              <p><code>Visitor<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;↓<br>Custom Domain (yourdomain.com)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;↓<br>CDN (Cloudflare)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;↓<br>EDS Live (.aem.live)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;↓<br>Content Delivered</code></p>
              <h3>Benefits:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Branded domain for your site</li>
                <li>CDN caching at edge locations</li>
                <li>DDoS protection and security</li>

              <p>Push invalidation is the automatic cache clearing that happens when you publish content through the Sidekick. It ensures visitors see fresh content immediately.</p>
              <h3>How It Works:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Author clicks "Publish" in Sidekick</li>
                <li>EDS publishes content to <code>.aem.live</code></li>
                <li>EDS calls CDN API to purge cache</li>
                <li>CDN clears cached content</li>
                <li>Next visitor gets fresh content</li>
                <li>Content re-caches automatically</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Configuration Required:</h3>
              <p>In <code>.helix/config</code>:</p>
              <p><code>cloudflare.apiToken = [your-api-token]<br>cloudflare.zoneId = [your-zone-id]</code></p>
              <h3>Without Push Invalidation:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Published changes don't appear until cache expires</li>
                <li>Manual "Purge Everything" required after each publish</li>
                <li>Visitors see stale content</li>
                <li>Frustrating authoring experience</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>With Push Invalidation:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Changes appear within 5-10 seconds</li>
                <li>Seamless publishing workflow</li>
                <li>Authors see results immediately</li>
                <li>No manual cache clearing needed</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Security:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>API token has minimum permissions (Cache Purge only)</li>
                <li>Token scoped to specific zone</li>
                <li>Rotate token annually</li>

              <p>EDS often uses a "double CDN" architecture where a customer's CDN (like Cloudflare) sits in front of Adobe's Fastly CDN.</p>
              <h3>Architecture Flow:</h3>
              <p><code>Visitor<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;↓<br>Cloudflare CDN (Your CDN)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;↓<br>Cloudflare Worker<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;↓<br>Adobe Fastly CDN (EDS CDN)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;↓<br>Adobe EDS Origin<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;↓<br>Content Delivered</code></p>
              <p><strong>Why Double CDN?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Layer 1: Your CDN (Cloudflare)</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Primary edge caching and security</li>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> DDoS protection, Web Application Firewall, custom SSL, analytics, cache control, 300+ edge locations</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Layer 2: Adobe CDN (Fastly)</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> EDS-specific optimizations</li>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Image optimization, content transformation, EDS platform features</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>How It Works:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Visitor requests <code>yourdomain.com/page</code></li>
                <li>Cloudflare checks its cache</li>
                <li>If miss, Cloudflare Worker proxies to <code>.aem.live</code></li>
                <li>Adobe Fastly processes request</li>
                <li>Content returned to Cloudflare</li>
                <li>Cloudflare caches and serves to visitor</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Performance Impact:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>First request: Two CDN hops (slower)</li>
                <li>Subsequent requests: Served from Cloudflare edge (fast)</li>
                <li>Cache hit rates typically 95%+</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Benefits:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>You control security and caching</li>
                <li>Cloudflare Free plan provides unlimited bandwidth</li>
                <li>Adobe handles EDS-specific optimizations</li>
                <li>Best of both platforms</li>

              <p>Publishing with the Adobe Sidekick is the primary way content authors push changes from draft to production.</p>
              <h3>Publishing Workflow:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Edit Content</strong> - Make changes in Google Doc</li>
                <li><strong>Preview</strong> - Click "Preview" in Sidekick to see draft</li>
                <li><strong>Review</strong> - Check content on <code>.aem.page</code> URL</li>
                <li><strong>Iterate</strong> - Make more edits if needed (instant preview updates)</li>
                <li><strong>Publish</strong> - Click "Publish" button when ready</li>
                <li><strong>Verify</strong> - Check production domain</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>What Happens on Publish:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Content pushed to <code>.aem.live</code> URL</li>
                <li>If push invalidation configured, CDN cache cleared</li>
                <li>Production domain serves fresh content within 5-10 seconds</li>
                <li>Content re-caches on next request</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Sidekick Buttons:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Preview</strong> - View draft on <code>.aem.page</code></li>
                <li><strong>Publish</strong> - Push to <code>.aem.live</code> and production</li>
                <li><strong>Unpublish</strong> - Remove from production (keeps preview)</li>
                <li><strong>Reload</strong> - Refresh preview after edits</li>
                <li><strong>Edit</strong> - Return to Google Doc</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Bulk Publishing:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Sidekick supports bulk operations</li>
                <li>Publish multiple pages at once</li>
                <li>Useful for site-wide updates</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Code Publishing:</h3>
              <p>For code changes (JavaScript, CSS):</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Commit to GitHub</li>
                <li>Changes automatically deploy to preview</li>
                <li>Use Sidekick on any page to activate for production</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The Sidekick makes publishing accessible to non-technical authors.</p>

              <p>Spreadsheets in EDS serve multiple purposes: as data sources, configuration files, and automatic indexing.</p>
              <h3>Spreadsheet Types:</h3>
              <h4>1. Data Sources</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Create spreadsheet in Google Drive folder</li>
                <li>EDS converts to JSON automatically</li>
                <li>Access via <code>/path/spreadsheet-name.json</code></li>
                <li>Use for product catalogs, team listings, etc.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>2. Configuration Sheets</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><code>headers</code> - Site header navigation</li>
                <li><code>footers</code> - Site footer content</li>
                <li><code>redirects</code> - URL redirect rules</li>
                <li><code>.helix/config</code> - Site configuration</li>
              </ul>

              <p>URL redirects in EDS are managed through a simple spreadsheet named <code>redirects</code>.</p>
              <h3>Setup:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Create spreadsheet named <code>redirects</code> in Google Drive root</li>
                <li>Add two columns: <code>Source</code> and <code>Destination</code></li>
                <li>Publish the spreadsheet</li>
                <li>EDS generates <code>/redirects.json</code></li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Spreadsheet Format:</h3>
              <p><code>| Source | Destination |<br>| /old-page | /new-page |<br>| /blog/2023/post | /blog/2024/post |<br>| /products/* | /shop/* |</code></p>
              <h3>Redirect Types:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Exact Match:</strong> <code>/old-page</code> → <code>/new-page</code></li>
                <li><strong>Wildcard:</strong> <code>/old/*</code> → <code>/new/*</code></li>
                <li><strong>External:</strong> <code>/link</code> → <code>https://external.com</code></li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Generated JSON:</h3>
              <p><code>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"data": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"source": "/old-page",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"destination": "/new-page"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>}</code></p>
              <h3>How It Works:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>User requests old URL</li>
                <li>EDS checks <code>redirects.json</code></li>
                <li>If match found, returns 301 redirect</li>
                <li>Browser navigates to new URL</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Best Practices:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Use 301 (permanent) redirects for moved content</li>
                <li>Keep redirect list under 1000 entries</li>
                <li>Test redirects after publishing</li>
                <li>Document why each redirect exists</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This spreadsheet-based approach makes redirect management accessible to content editors.</p>

              <p>EDS relies on three core JavaScript files that orchestrate page loading and enhancement.</p>
              <h4>1. aem.js (formerly lib-franklin.js)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Foundation utility functions</li>

                    <li><code>toClassName()</code> - Convert text to CSS class</li>
                    <li><code>readBlockConfig()</code> - Extract block configuration</li>
                    <li><code>loadCSS()</code> - Load stylesheets dynamically</li>
                    <li><code>getMetadata()</code> - Access page metadata</li>
                    <li><code>createOptimizedPicture()</code> - Generate responsive images</li>
                    <li><code>decorateButtons()</code> - Enhance links to buttons</li>
                    <li><code>loadBlock()</code> - Load and decorate blocks</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>DO NOT MODIFY:</strong> This file should never be edited</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>2. scripts.js</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Orchestrates three-phase loading (E-L-D)</li>
                <li><strong>Key Functions:</strong> <ul>
                    <li><code>buildAutoBlocks()</code> - Create autoblocks (hero, buttons)</li>
                    <li><code>loadEager()</code> - Load critical first section</li>
                    <li><code>loadLazy()</code> - Load remaining sections</li>
                    <li><code>loadDelayed()</code> - Load analytics after 3s delay</li>
                  </ul>

                <li><strong>Customizable:</strong> Can add project-specific logic</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>3. delayed.js</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Non-critical functionality after 3-second delay</li>
                <li><strong>Common Uses:</strong> <ul>
                    <li>Analytics (Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics)</li>
                    <li>Cookie consent banners</li>
                    <li>Marketing pixels</li>

              </ul>
              <h3>Load Order:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li><code>aem.js</code> - Loaded in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></li>
                <li><code>scripts.js</code> - Loaded in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></li>
                <li>Page renders, first section loads (Eager)</li>
                <li>Remaining sections load (Lazy)</li>
                <li>After 3 seconds, <code>delayed.js</code> imports</li>
              </ol>
              <p>These three files form the backbone of EDS's performance-optimized architecture.</p>

              <p>GitHub serves as the code repository for EDS projects, providing version control, collaboration, and automatic deployment.</p>
              <h3>What Lives in GitHub:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>JavaScript files (<code>scripts.js</code>, <code>aem.js</code>, block code)</li>
                <li>CSS files (<code>styles.css</code>, block styles)</li>
                <li>Configuration (<code>fstab.yaml</code>, <code>.helix/</code>)</li>
                <li>Default JSON files (fallback data)</li>
                <li>Documentation and README files</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>What Lives in Google Drive:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Content documents (pages written in Google Docs)</li>
                <li>Images and media assets</li>
                <li>Spreadsheets (data, configuration)</li>
                <li>Author-managed content</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Branch-Based Previews:</h3>
              <p>Every GitHub branch gets its own preview URL:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><code>main</code> → <code>main--repo--owner.aem.page</code></li>
                <li><code>feature</code> → <code>feature--repo--owner.aem.page</code></li>
                <li><code>dev</code> → <code>dev--repo--owner.aem.page</code></li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Deployment Flow:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Developer pushes code to GitHub branch</li>
                <li>EDS automatically deploys to that branch's preview URL</li>
                <li>Test changes on <code>branch--repo--owner.aem.page</code></li>
                <li>Merge to <code>main</code> when ready</li>
                <li>Production uses <code>main</code> branch code</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Fallback Pattern:</h3>
              <p>Create matching JSON files in GitHub for developer-managed defaults. Authors can override by creating spreadsheets in Google Drive.</p>
              <h3>Example:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Create <code>/data/products.json</code> in GitHub (default)</li>
                <li>Authors can create <code>products.xlsx</code> in Drive (override)</li>
                <li>Drive version takes precedence when published</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This separation enables parallel workflows: developers code in GitHub while authors write in Google Docs.</p>

              <p>Debugging EDS applications involves understanding the transformation process and using browser developer tools effectively.</p>
              <h3>Essential Debugging Techniques:</h3>
              <h4>1. Compare Raw vs Processed HTML</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>View raw HTML: Add <code>.plain.html</code> to URL</li>
                <li>Example: <code>/page.plain.html</code> shows server output before JavaScript</li>
                <li>Compare with final DOM in DevTools</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>2. Inspect Network Requests</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Open Network tab in DevTools</li>
                <li>Check which CSS and JS files load</li>
                <li>Verify blocks load their assets</li>
                <li>Look for 404s or failed requests</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>3. Add Debug Logging</h4>
              <p><code>// In block code<br>// eslint-disable-next-line no-console<br>console.log('Block data:', data);<br><br>// In scripts.js<br>// eslint-disable-next-line no-console<br>console.log('Loading block:', blockName);</code></p>
              <h4>4. Use DOM Breakpoints</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Right-click element in DevTools</li>
                <li>Select "Break on" → "Subtree modifications"</li>
                <li>See exactly when DOM changes occur</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>5. Check Block Loading</h4>
              <p><code>// See which blocks are loading<br>document.querySelectorAll('[data-block-status]')</code></p>
              <h4>6. Inspect CSS Application</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Use Computed tab in DevTools</li>
                <li>See which CSS rules apply</li>
                <li>Check for specificity issues</li>
                <li>Verify CSS file loaded</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>7. Test Without Cache</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)</li>
                <li>Or disable cache in DevTools Network tab</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Common Issues:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Block not appearing:</strong> Check block name matches file name</li>
                <li><strong>Styles not applying:</strong> Verify CSS file name matches block</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript errors:</strong> Check browser console for errors</li>
                <li><strong>Content not updating:</strong> Clear CDN cache or hard refresh</li>
              </ul>

                <li><strong>Select Best Match:</strong> <ul>
                    <li>Desktop + WebP support → 2000px WebP</li>
                    <li>Mobile + WebP support → 750px WebP</li>
                    <li>Desktop + No WebP → 2000px PNG</li>
                    <li>Mobile + No WebP → 750px PNG</li>

              <p>Content-Driven Development (CDD) is an EDS methodology that prioritizes content structure and author experience before implementing technical functionality.</p>
              <h3>CDD Process:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Content Model First</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Design how authors will create content</li>
                    <li>Define table structure for blocks</li>
                    <li>Consider author mental model</li>
                    <li>Keep it simple and intuitive</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Create Test Content</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Authors create example content in Google Docs</li>
                    <li>Validate content model is author-friendly</li>
                    <li>Adjust model based on feedback</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Implement Functionality</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Write JavaScript to transform content</li>
                    <li>Add CSS for styling</li>
                    <li>Test with real content examples</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Document and Iterate</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Create <code>example.md</code> with usage</li>
                    <li>Write <code>README.md</code> with details</li>
                    <li>Gather author feedback</li>
                    <li>Refine based on usage</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Example - Hero Block:</h3>
              <h3>Bad (Code-First):</h3>
              <p><code>// Complex table structure<br>| Hero | image | title | subtitle | cta-text | cta-url |<br>| ... complicated for authors</code></p>
              <h3>Good (Content-First):</h3>
              <p><code>// Natural for authors - just image + heading<br>[Image]<br># Page Title</code></p>
              <p>EDS auto-creates hero block—no table needed!</p>
              <h3>CDD Principles:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Author Needs First</strong> - Optimize for content creators</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Content</strong> - Use familiar document patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Complexity</strong> - Simpler content models win</li>
                <li><strong>Test Early</strong> - Validate with real authors</li>
                <li><strong>Iterate</strong> - Refine based on usage</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Benefits:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Better author experience</li>
                <li>Fewer authoring errors</li>
                <li>Faster content creation</li>
                <li>More maintainable blocks</li>
                <li>Reduced training needs</li>
              </ul>
              <p>CDD ensures technical implementation serves content creation, not the other way around.</p>
