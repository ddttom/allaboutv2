# Import Gallery Grid Block

This block represents the image gallery grid of the imported Adobe Lightroom gallery design.

## Usage

The Import Gallery Grid block creates a responsive grid of images.

## Authoring

No specific authoring is required in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. The block content is generated programmatically.

## Styling

The block uses the following CSS classes:
- `.import-gallery-grid`: Main container
- `.import-gallery-item`: Individual image container

Custom styling can be applied by modifying the `import-gallery-grid.css` file.

## Behavior

The gallery grid is responsive and adjusts the number of columns based on screen size. Images have a hover effect.

## Accessibility

- All images include alt text for screen readers.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Implement lazy loading for images to improve performance.
2. Add support for custom image upload through block configuration.
3. Implement infinite scrolling or pagination for large galleries.
4. Add filtering and sorting options for the gallery.
