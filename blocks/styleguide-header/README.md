# Styleguide Header

This block displays a header for the style guide, featuring the profile information of a LinkedIn user.

## Usage

The styleguide-header block fetches profile information from a given LinkedIn URL and displays the user's name, title, and profile picture.

## Authoring

To use this block in a Franklin project, add the following to your Google Docs or Microsoft Word document:

| styleguide-header |
|-------------------|
| LinkedIn Profile URL |

## Styling

The block uses custom CSS classes for styling. You can customize the appearance by modifying the `styleguide-header.css` file.

## Behavior

The block fetches profile information asynchronously and displays it in a responsive layout. If there's an error fetching the data, it will display an error message.

## Accessibility

- The profile picture includes an alt text with the user's name.
- Semantic HTML is used for proper structure and screen reader compatibility.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Add error handling for cases where specific profile elements are not found.
- Implement caching to reduce API calls and improve performance.
- Add options for customizing the layout or information displayed.
