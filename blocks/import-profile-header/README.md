# Import Profile Header Block

This block represents the header section of a LinkedIn profile, including the profile picture, name, headline, location, and connection information.

## Usage

Use this block at the top of the profile page to display the user's key information.

## Variations

### Default
Displays full profile information including background image, profile picture, name, headline, location, connections, and action buttons.

### Compact
A condensed version that only shows the profile picture, name, and headline. Use the `(compact)` variation for a more concise display.

## Styling

The block includes styles for the profile background image, profile picture, name, headline, location, connections, and action buttons. The compact variation adjusts these styles for a more condensed layout.

## Behavior

The JavaScript file populates the block with the provided information and creates the structure for the profile header. It adapts the layout based on whether the compact variation is used.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance by modifying the CSS variables in the import-styling block.
