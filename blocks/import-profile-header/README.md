# Import Profile Header

This block represents the header section of a LinkedIn profile, including the profile picture, name, headline, and location.

## Usage

Place this block at the top of the profile page to display the user's basic information.

## Authoring

In your Google Docs or Microsoft Word document, create a table with the following structure:

| import-profile-header |
|------------------------|
| Name |
| Headline |
| Location |

## Styling

The block uses CSS classes for styling. You can customize the appearance by modifying the CSS file.

## Behavior

The block fetches the profile picture from a predefined URL and creates an optimized picture using the `createOptimizedPicture` function from `aem.js`.

## Accessibility

The profile picture includes an alt text for screen readers.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Add support for custom profile picture URLs.
2. Implement a fallback image if the profile picture fails to load.
3. Add social media links to the header.
