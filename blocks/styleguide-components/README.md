# Styleguide Components

This block displays various UI components used in the LinkedIn design system, showcasing their appearance and usage.

## Usage

Place this block in your style guide to demonstrate the different UI components used across the platform.

## Authoring

In your Google Docs or Microsoft Word document, create a table with one row and one column:

The block will automatically fetch the components data from the `styleguide-components.json` file.

## Styling

The block uses the following CSS classes:
- `.styleguide-components`: Main container
- `.component-section`: Container for each component
- `.component-example`: Visual representation of the component
- `.component-usage`: Code snippet showing how to use the component

## Behavior

The block fetches components data from a JSON file and dynamically creates examples and usage instructions for each component.

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure with appropriate heading levels
- Examples are accompanied by descriptions and usage instructions

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Add interactive elements to demonstrate component behavior
- Include variations of components (e.g., different button styles)
- Provide guidelines for component customization
- Implement a search or filter functionality for easier navigation
