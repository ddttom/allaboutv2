# Styleguide Components Block

This block showcases the common UI components used in the BBC website design.

## Usage

Use this block to display and explain the various UI components such as buttons, cards, and search elements.

## Authoring

In your Franklin document, create a table with the block name:

| styleguide-components |
| :--- |
| buttons |
| cards |
| search |

## Styling

The block uses custom CSS for component styling. Key classes:
- `.styleguide-components`: Main container
- `.component-section`: Container for each component type
- `.component-demo`: Display area for component examples

## Behavior

This block includes static representations of interactive components. For full interactivity, additional JavaScript may be required.

## Accessibility

- Components are designed with accessibility in mind, using appropriate color contrasts and semantic HTML
- Interactive elements (e.g., buttons) are keyboard accessible

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Add more component types (e.g., form elements, navigation menus)
- Implement fully interactive versions of the components
- Include code snippets for each component to aid developers
