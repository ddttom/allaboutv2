# Teleprompter3

The Teleprompter3 block is an advanced Franklin component that provides a customizable teleprompter functionality for web pages.

To use the Teleprompter3 block, simply add it to your Franklin page using the following markdown:

| teleprompter3 |
| ------------- |
|               |

## Authoring

No specific content is required within the Teleprompter3 block in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. The block automatically reads and processes all text content on the page below its position.

## Styling

The Teleprompter3 block comes with pre-defined styles. You can customize its appearance by modifying the CSS variables or adding custom CSS classes.

## Behavior

- When clicked, the icon opens a full teleprompter interface
- Reads and displays all text content from the page
- Allows scrolling through content using mouse wheel or arrow keys
- Supports pause/resume functionality with the spacebar
- Can be closed using the Esc key
- Draggable interface for repositioning

## Dependencies
