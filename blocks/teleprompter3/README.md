# Teleprompter3

The Teleprompter3 block is an advanced Franklin component that provides a customizable teleprompter functionality for web pages.

## Usage

To use the Teleprompter3 block, simply add it to your Franklin page using the following structure:

| Teleprompter3 |
|---------------|
|               |

## Authoring

No specific content is required within the Teleprompter3 block in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. The block will automatically extract and display all text content from the page below its position.

## Styling

The Teleprompter3 block comes with pre-defined styles. You can customize its appearance by modifying the CSS variables or adding custom CSS rules.

## Behavior

1. A clickable teleprompter icon appears in the top-left corner of the viewport.
2. Clicking the icon activates the teleprompter, displaying page content.
3. Use arrow keys or mouse wheel to scroll through content.
4. Press spacebar to pause/resume.
5. Press Esc to close the teleprompter.

## Dependencies

This block relies on the `aem.js` script for optimized image handling.

## Accessibility

- The teleprompter icon is keyboard focusable.
- All controls are operable via keyboard.
- ARIA labels are used for screen reader compatibility.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Add text size adjustment controls.
2. Implement custom scrolling speed options.
3. Allow users to save their position and resume later.
4. Add support for different color themes.
5. Implement multi-language support for UI elements.

These improvements would enhance user experience and make the teleprompter more versatile for different use cases.
