Note: In compact mode, a floating icon (ðŸ“š) with the text "Blogroll" will appear in the top-left corner of the viewport. If no path is specified, it will default to the current page's folder path and page name (without any part number). The filtering is case-insensitive. A "Show All Posts" button at the bottom of the panel allows you to toggle between all posts and the filtered view.
