# Import Header Block

This block represents the header of the imported Adobe Lightroom gallery design.

## Usage

The Import Header block creates a responsive header with a logo and navigation menu.

## Authoring

No specific authoring is required in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. The block content is generated programmatically.

## Styling

The block uses the following CSS classes:
- `.import-header`: Main container
- `.import-header-logo`: Logo container
- `.import-header-nav`: Navigation container

Custom styling can be applied by modifying the `import-header.css` file.

## Behavior

The header is responsive and adjusts its layout for smaller screens.

## Accessibility

- The logo image includes an alt text for screen readers.
- Navigation links are keyboard accessible.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Add support for custom logo upload through block configuration.
2. Implement a mobile menu toggle for smaller screens.
3. Allow customization of navigation items through authoring.
