# Import Header Block

This block recreates the header of the LinkedIn profile page, including the logo and navigation items.

## Usage

Include this block at the top of your page to display the LinkedIn-style header.

## Authoring

In the block table:
1. The first cell should contain the logo image.
2. Subsequent cells should contain navigation item text.

## Styling

The header is styled to match the LinkedIn design, with a fixed position at the top of the page and responsive behavior for mobile devices.

## Behavior

The header remains fixed at the top of the page while scrolling. On mobile devices, only the logo is displayed.

## Accessibility

- The logo is wrapped in an anchor tag for easy navigation to the home page.
- Navigation items are semantically structured using the `<nav>` element.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Implement a mobile menu for smaller screen sizes.
- Add aria labels to improve screen reader navigation.
