# Import Header Block

This block recreates the LinkedIn header component for the imported profile design.

## Usage

Include the Import Header block at the top of your Franklin document to display the LinkedIn-style navigation header.

## Authoring

No specific authoring is required for this block. It automatically generates the header content when included in the document.

## Styling

The block uses CSS to style the header, including the logo and navigation items. Custom styles can be applied by modifying the `import-header.css` file.

## Behavior

The JavaScript functionality creates the header structure, including the LinkedIn logo and navigation items. The navigation items are currently placeholder links.

## Accessibility

- The logo includes an alt text for screen readers.
- Navigation items are created as links for keyboard accessibility.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Add functionality to make the navigation items link to actual pages or sections.
2. Implement a responsive design for smaller screen sizes, possibly including a mobile menu.
3. Add aria labels to improve accessibility for screen readers.
4. Include an option to customize navigation items through block parameters.
