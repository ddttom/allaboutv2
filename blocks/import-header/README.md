# import-header

This block represents the LinkedIn header navigation, including the logo and main menu items.

## Usage

Use this block at the top of the page to provide consistent navigation across the LinkedIn-style profile.

## Authoring

In your Google Docs or Microsoft Word document, simply include the block name:

| import-header |
| :---- |
| |

No additional content is required as the menu items are hardcoded in the JavaScript.

## Styling

The block uses custom CSS classes for styling. You can customize the appearance by modifying the `import-header.css` file.

## Behavior

The block creates a responsive header with the LinkedIn logo and main navigation items. On mobile devices, the navigation menu is hidden to conserve space.

## Accessibility

The block uses semantic HTML elements (nav, ul, li) to ensure proper structure and navigation for screen readers.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Make menu items configurable through the authoring interface.
2. Implement a mobile-friendly navigation menu (e.g., hamburger menu).
3. Add active state styling for the current page in the navigation.
4. Include a search bar functionality.
