# Counter Block Examples

## Basic Counter Starting at Zero

The simplest implementation starts the counter at zero:

| Counter |
|---------|
| 0       |

## Counter with Positive Initial Value

Set any positive starting value:

| Counter |
|---------|
| 42      |

## Counter with Large Initial Value

The counter supports large numbers:

| Counter |
|---------|
| 1000    |

## Counter with Negative Initial Value

Negative numbers are also supported:

| Counter |
|---------|
| -10     |

## Counter with Empty Value

When no initial value is provided, it defaults to 0:

| Counter |
|---------|
|         |

## Multiple Counters on Same Page

You can use multiple counter instances:

| Counter |
|---------|
| 5       |

Some text between counters to show they work independently.

| Counter |
|---------|
| 100     |

Another counter with a different starting value.

| Counter |
|---------|
| -25     |

## Invalid Values (Error Handling)

If an invalid value is provided, the block displays an error message:

| Counter |
|---------|
| abc     |

| Counter |
|---------|
| $%^     |
