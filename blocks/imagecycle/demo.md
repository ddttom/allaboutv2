## How It Works

1. The Imagecycle block automatically rotates through the provided images every 5 seconds.
2. Hovering over the carousel pauses the rotation.
3. Moving the mouse away from the carousel resumes rotation, immediately advancing to the next image.
4. Users can manually navigate using the indicator dots below the images or by using left/right arrow keys.

## Customization Options

- Adjust the size of the carousel by modifying the width and height in the CSS.
- Change the background color by updating the `background-color` property in the CSS.
- Modify the rotation speed by changing the interval in the JavaScript file.

## Potential Use Cases

1. Product galleries on e-commerce websites
2. Showcasing portfolio items for creative professionals
3. Highlighting featured content on news or blog websites
4. Displaying testimonials with customer photos
5. Presenting before-and-after images for services
