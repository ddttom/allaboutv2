# Imagecycle Demo

The Imagecycle block is a versatile and engaging component for Franklin projects, designed to showcase a rotating carousel of images. This demo page illustrates the functionality and features of the Imagecycle block.

## How It Works

The Imagecycle block automatically rotates through a set of images, displaying one image at a time. Here are its key features:

1. **Automatic Rotation**: Images change every 5 seconds.
2. **Pause on Hover**: Rotation pauses when the user hovers over the image.
3. **Manual Navigation**: Users can navigate using left and right arrow keys.
4. **Placement Indicators**: Visual indicators show the current image position.
5. **Randomized Order**: Images are displayed in a random order on each page load.
6. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing.
