# Styleguide Layout

This block displays the layout principles used in the LinkedIn design system, showcasing the grid system and spacing guidelines.

## Usage

Place this block in your style guide to demonstrate the layout structure and spacing used across the platform.

## Authoring

In your Google Docs or Microsoft Word document, create a table with one row and one column:

| styleguide-layout |
| :---- |

The block will automatically fetch the layout data from the `styleguide-layout.json` file.

## Styling

The block uses the following CSS classes:
- `.styleguide-layout`: Main container
- `.layout-section`: Container for each layout section (grid, spacing)
- `.grid-example`: Visual representation of the grid system
- `.grid-column`: Individual column in the grid example
- `.space-example`: Container for each spacing example

## Behavior

The block fetches layout data from a JSON file and dynamically creates examples for the grid system and spacing guidelines.

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure with appropriate heading levels
- Visual representations are accompanied by text descriptions

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Add interactive elements to demonstrate responsive behavior
- Include examples of common layout patterns used in LinkedIn
- Provide guidelines for content placement within the grid system
