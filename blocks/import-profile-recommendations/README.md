# Import Profile Recommendations

This block represents the recommendations section of a LinkedIn profile, displaying testimonials from colleagues and professional contacts.

## Usage

Place this block towards the end of the profile to showcase professional endorsements and testimonials.

## Authoring

In your Google Docs or Microsoft Word document, create a table with the following structure:

| import-profile-recommendations |
|--------------------------------|
| Recommender Name |
| Relationship to Recommender |
| Recommendation Text |

Repeat the rows for each recommendation.

## Styling

The block uses CSS classes for styling. You can customize the appearance by modifying the CSS file.

## Behavior

The block takes the content from each row and creates a list item for each recommendation, displaying the recommender's name, relationship, and the recommendation text.

## Accessibility

The recommendations are presented as a structured list with proper headings, which is accessible to screen readers.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Add support for recommender profile pictures.
2. Implement a carousel for multiple recommendations.
3. Include an option to highlight or feature specific recommendations.
