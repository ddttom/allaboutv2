# Import Skills Block

This block represents the "Skills" section of a LinkedIn profile, displaying the user's professional skills.

## Usage

Use this block to showcase the user's key skills and competencies.

## Variations

### Default
Displays skills in a vertical list.

### Grid
Displays skills in a grid layout. Use the `(grid)` variation for a more compact display of multiple skills.

## Styling

The block includes styles for the section title, individual skill items with icons, and a "show more" option. The grid variation uses a responsive grid layout for skill items.

## Behavior

The JavaScript file takes the provided skills and displays them either in a list or grid format, depending on the variation. It also adds a "show more" option if there are more than 6 skills.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance by modifying the CSS variables in the import-styling block.
