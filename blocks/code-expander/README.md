## Usage

To use the Code Expander block in your Franklin project:

1. Place the `code-expander.js` file in the `blocks/code-expander/` directory.
2. Mark text with a courier font in the document, triggering autoblocking.
3. Use the CodeExpander block once in the document

The component will automatically detect the language and apply appropriate styling and functionality.

## Authoring

When creating content in Google Docs or Microsoft Word, use the following structure:

| CodeExpander |
| ------------- |

## Styling

The block uses the following CSS classes:

- `.code-expander-wrapper`: Wraps the entire component (copy button and code)
- `.code-expander-copy`: Styles the copy button
- `.code-expander-copy-text`: Styles the "Copy code" text
- `.code-expander-code`: Wraps the code element for additional styling control

The `<pre>` element within `.code-expander-code` has a light background for visual distinction.

## Behavior

- A "Copy code" button with a clipboard icon (ðŸ“‹) is added above each decorated element.
- The code is displayed within a light background for better visual separation.
- Clicking the button copies the code content to the clipboard.
- The button text changes to "Copied!" with a checkmark (âœ…) for 2 seconds after successful copying.

## Accessibility

- The copy button has appropriate `aria-label` attributes for screen readers.
- The button's state changes are reflected in the `aria-label` for accessibility.

## Dependencies

This block has no external dependencies.
