# Markdown Block Self-Review

## Code Review

### JavaScript (markdown.js)

1. All necessary functions are present and properly implemented.
2. `const` is used appropriately for variables that are not reassigned.
3. No unused imports are present.
4. No nested templates are used in the JavaScript code.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using CSS variables for color values in the `highlightSyntax` function.
- Add ARIA attributes to the copy button for better accessibility.

### CSS (markdown.css)

1. The CSS file includes styles from the showcaser block.
2. No unused CSS rules are present.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Organize CSS variables into logical groups at the top of the file.
- Add comments to separate different sections (e.g., layout, typography, responsive design).
- Consider using more CSS variables for consistent theming.

### Accessibility

1. The structure of the generated HTML is semantic and screen-reader friendly.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Add ARIA attributes to the copy button (e.g., `aria-label="Copy code to clipboard"`).
- Ensure proper focus management when navigating through code blocks.

### Franklin Variations

No specific variations were implemented in the current version. Consider adding variations for different styling options or layouts.

### README.md, example.md, and demo.md

1. The README.md file is present and contains relevant information.
2. The example.md file is present and demonstrates the usage of the Markdown block.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Create a demo.md file to showcase more complex examples and variations.
- Ensure that all code examples use single backticks instead of `<pre>` tags or triple backticks.

## Action Items

1. Update markdown.js:
   - Add ARIA attributes to the copy button.
   - Consider using CSS variables for syntax highlighting colors.

2. Update markdown.css:
   - Organize CSS variables at the top of the file.
   - Add section comments for better organization.
   - Implement more CSS variables for consistent theming.

3. Create a demo.md file with more complex examples.

4. Review and update README.md to ensure all code examples use single backticks.
