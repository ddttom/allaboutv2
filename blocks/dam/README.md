# DAM Block

The DAM (Digital Asset Management) block displays a list of digital assets with associated metadata in a JSON format.

## Usage

The DAM block is used to showcase digital assets with their descriptions, classifications, tags, image paths, and additional information.

## Authoring

Create a table in your Google Docs or Microsoft Word document with the following structure:

| DAM | Description | Classification | Tag | Image | Additional Info |
|-----|-------------|----------------|-----|-------|-----------------|
| | Asset description | Asset class | Asset tag | Image URL or embed | Extra details |

- The first cell should contain "DAM" to indicate the block type.
- Each subsequent row represents an asset with its metadata and image.

## Styling

The block uses CSS classes for styling:
- `.dam`: Main container styles
- `.dam pre`: Styles for the JSON output container
- `.dam code`: Styles for the JSON text

Custom CSS variables can be used to adjust the styling to match your site's theme.

## Behavior

The block processes the table data to create a JSON output:
1. Extracts metadata and image paths from the table.
2. Generates a formatted JSON output displayed in a `<pre><code>` element.

## Accessibility

The JSON output is presented in a structured format for easy reading by assistive technologies.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Add filtering and sorting options for the JSON data based on classifications or tags.
2. Implement error handling for missing or invalid image URLs.
3. Add a search functionality to filter assets based on descriptions or metadata.
4. Consider adding an option to display the assets visually alongside the JSON data.
5. Implement data validation to ensure all required fields are filled.
