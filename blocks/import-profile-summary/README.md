# Import Profile Summary

This block represents the summary or "About" section of a LinkedIn profile.

## Usage

Place this block after the profile header to provide a brief overview of the user's professional background and expertise.

## Authoring

In your Google Docs or Microsoft Word document, create a table with the following structure:

| import-profile-summary |
|------------------------|
| Summary text goes here |

## Styling

The block uses CSS classes for styling. You can customize the appearance by modifying the CSS file.

## Behavior

The block takes the content from the table cell and displays it as a paragraph under an "About" heading.

## Accessibility

The summary is presented as regular text content, which is accessible to screen readers.

## Suggestions for Improvement

2. Implement a "Read more" functionality for long summaries.
3. Add the option to include bullet points for key highlights.
