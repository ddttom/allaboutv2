# Cube6 Block

The Cube6 block creates a 3D rotatable cube with 6 sides, each containing an image that links to a specified URL.

## Features

- 3D cube with 6 sides
- Each face contains an image and a link
- Rotatable in all directions on mouseover
- Double-click to navigate to the linked page
- Gray background on the web page

## Usage

To use the Cube6 block, create a table in your document with 6 rows. Each row should have two cells:

1. The first cell should contain the image URL
2. The second cell should contain the link URL

Example:

| Image URL | Link URL |
|-----------|----------|
| /path/to/image1.jpg | <https://example.com/page1> |
| /path/to/image2.jpg | <https://example.com/page2> |
| /path/to/image3.jpg | <https://example.com/page3> |
| /path/to/image4.jpg | <https://example.com/page4> |
| /path/to/image5.jpg | <https://example.com/page5> |
| /path/to/image6.jpg | <https://example.com/page6> |

The block will automatically create the 3D cube based on this content.
