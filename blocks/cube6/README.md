# Cube6 Block

This block creates a 3D cube with 6 sides, each containing an image that links to a specified URL. The cube is rotatable in all directions when the mouse hovers over it, and double-clicking an image navigates to its associated link.

## Block Structure

The block should be structured as a table with 6 rows, each row representing one face of the cube:

| Image | Link |
|-------|------|
| face1.jpg | <https://example.com/link1> |
| face2.jpg | <https://example.com/link2> |
| face3.jpg | <https://example.com/link3> |
| face4.jpg | <https://example.com/link4> |
| face5.jpg | <https://example.com/link5> |
| face6.jpg | <https://example.com/link6> |
