# import-footer

This block represents the LinkedIn footer, including the logo and copyright information.

## Usage

Use this block at the bottom of the page to provide consistent footer information across the LinkedIn-style profile.

## Authoring

In your Google Docs or Microsoft Word document, simply include the block name:

| import-footer |
| :---- |
| |

No additional content is required as the footer content is hardcoded in the JavaScript.

## Styling

The block uses custom CSS classes for styling. You can customize the appearance by modifying the `import-footer.css` file.

## Behavior

The block creates a simple footer with the LinkedIn logo and copyright information, centered on the page.

## Accessibility

The block uses semantic HTML elements (footer) to ensure proper structure for screen readers.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Make footer content configurable through the authoring interface.
2. Add links to important pages (e.g., About, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service).
3. Implement a multi-column footer layout for better organization of links and information.
4. Include social media icons and links.
