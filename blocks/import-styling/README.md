# Import Styling Block

This block provides global styling for the imported LinkedIn profile design.

## Usage

The Import Styling block should be included at the top of your Franklin document to ensure consistent styling across all imported LinkedIn profile components.

## Authoring

No specific authoring is required for this block. It automatically applies global styles when included in the document.

## Styling

The block defines CSS variables for colors, fonts, and common elements used throughout the LinkedIn profile design. These variables can be customized to adjust the overall look of the imported profile.

## Behavior

This block doesn't have any JavaScript functionality. It only provides CSS styling.

## Accessibility

The defined styles aim to maintain good color contrast and readability, supporting accessibility standards.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Consider adding dark mode support by defining alternative color variables.
2. Implement responsive typography using relative units (e.g., rem) for better scalability across different screen sizes.
3. Add more specific variables for different text styles (e.g., headings, body text) to ensure consistency throughout the profile.
