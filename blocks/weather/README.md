# Weather Block

This block displays the current weather information based on the user's geolocation.

## Usage

The Weather block fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the user's current location.

## Authoring

No specific authoring is required in Google Docs or Microsoft Word for this block.

## Styling

The block uses the following CSS classes for styling:
- `.weather`: Main container for the weather block
- `.weather-info`: Container for weather information
- `.weather-info h3`: City name
- `.weather-info p`: Temperature and weather description

## Behavior

1. The block attempts to get the user's current location using the Geolocation API.
2. It then fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. The weather information (city name, temperature, and description) is displayed.

## Dependencies

- OpenWeatherMap API (requires an API key)
- Geolocation API (browser feature)

## Accessibility

- Weather information is presented in a clear, readable format.
- Error messages are displayed if weather data cannot be fetched.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Add icons to represent different weather conditions.
2. Implement a fallback location if geolocation is not available.
3. Add an option to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
4. Include more detailed weather information (e.g., humidity, wind speed).
5. Implement caching to reduce API calls and improve performance.
