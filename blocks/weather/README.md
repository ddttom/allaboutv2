# Weather Block

This block displays the current weather information based on the user's geolocation.

## Usage

The Weather block fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API using the user's current location.

## Authoring

No specific authoring is required in Google Docs or Microsoft Word for this block.

## Styling

The block uses the following CSS classes for styling:
- `.weather`: Main container for the weather block
- `.weather-info`: Container for weather information
- `.weather-info h2`: City name
- `.weather-info p`: Temperature and weather description

## Behavior

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Add error handling for when geolocation is not available or denied by the user.

3. Add options for different temperature units (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
4. Include weather icons for better visual representation.
5. Add forecast information for upcoming days.
