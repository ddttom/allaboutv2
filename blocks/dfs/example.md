| Category | Subcategory | Question | Short Answer | Detailed Answer | External Link | Related Resources/Tags |
| :------- | :---------- | :------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :------------ | :--------------------- |
| API | Authentication | What authentication methods are supported? | API keys and OAuth 2.0 | We support two authentication methods: **API Keys** for server-to-server communication (simplest option) and **OAuth 2.0** for applications that need to access user data on their behalf. API keys should be passed in the Authorization header as "Bearer YOUR_KEY". OAuth requires implementing the authorization code flow. Choose API keys for internal tools and OAuth for third-party applications. | API Keys Guide: https://api.allabout.network/auth/api-keys<br>OAuth 2.0 Setup: https://api.allabout.network/auth/oauth<br>Security Best Practices: https://api.allabout.network/security | [Developer Portal](https://allabout.network/developers) [OAuth Flow Diagram](https://api.allabout.network/diagrams/oauth) #api #authentication #oauth #security |
| API | Rate Limits | What are the API rate limits? | Varies by plan: 100-10,000 requests per hour | Rate limits are enforced per API key and vary by account tier: **Free:** 100 requests/hour, **Pro:** 1,000 requests/hour, **Enterprise:** 10,000+ requests/hour (custom limits available). Rate limit headers are included in every response (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset). When you exceed your limit, you'll receive a 429 status code. Implement exponential backoff for retries. | Rate Limits Documentation: https://api.allabout.network/docs/rate-limits<br>Upgrade Plans: /pricing#api<br>Retry Strategies: https://api.allabout.network/docs/retries | [API Pricing](https://allabout.network/pricing) [Status Page](https://status.allabout.network) #api #rate-limits #pricing |
| API | Errors | How do I handle API errors? | Use HTTP status codes and error objects | All API errors return standard HTTP status codes and a JSON error object with details. Common status codes: **400** Bad Request (invalid parameters), **401** Unauthorized (invalid/missing API key), **403** Forbidden (insufficient permissions), **404** Not Found (resource doesn't exist), **429** Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded), **500** Internal Server Error (we're investigating). Error responses include a "message" field describing what went wrong and an "error_code" for programmatic handling. Log errors and implement retry logic for transient failures (500, 503). | Error Handling Guide: https://api.allabout.network/docs/errors<br>Status Codes Reference: https://api.allabout.network/docs/status-codes | [API Reference](https://api.allabout.network/reference) #api #errors #troubleshooting |

The SDK handles authentication, request signing, error handling, and automatic retries. It works in both Node.js and browser environments. Basic usage: Create a client with your API key, then call methods like `client.users.get()` or `client.posts.create()`. Full TypeScript support included with type definitions. | npm Package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@allabout/sdk<br>JavaScript SDK Docs: https://api.allabout.network/sdk/javascript<br>GitHub Repository: https://github.com/allabout/sdk-javascript | [SDK Documentation](https://api.allabout.network/sdks) [Code Examples](https://github.com/allabout/sdk-javascript/tree/main/examples) #sdk #javascript #npm #typescript |
