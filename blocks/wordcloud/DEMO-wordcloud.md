## How It Works

The Word Cloud block processes the content of the table above, counting the frequency of each word or phrase. It then generates a visually appealing cloud where the size of each word corresponds to its frequency. The most common terms appear larger and more prominently.

## Customization

You can customize the Word Cloud by modifying the content in the table. Add or remove terms to reflect different topics or focus areas. The block will automatically adjust the display based on the new content.
