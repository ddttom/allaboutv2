## How It Works

The Word Cloud block processes the content above, counting the frequency of each word or phrase. It then generates a visually appealing cloud where the size of each word corresponds to its frequency. The most common terms appear larger and more prominently.

## Customization

You can customize the Word Cloud by modifying the content in the wordcloud section. Add or remove terms to reflect different topics or focus areas. The block will automatically adjust the display based on the new content.

## Use Cases

1. Visualizing key topics in a blog post or article
2. Summarizing skills or technologies in a portfolio
3. Highlighting popular tags or categories in a content management system
4. Presenting survey results or feedback in a visually engaging manner
