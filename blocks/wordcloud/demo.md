## How It Works

The WordCloud block processes the content within its rows, counting the frequency of each word or phrase. It then generates a visually appealing word cloud where the size of each word corresponds to its frequency. The most frequent words appear larger, while less frequent words are smaller.

## Customization Options

- Background color can be customized using CSS variables.
- The color palette for words can be adjusted in the JavaScript file.
- The maximum number of displayed words can be modified (currently set to 50).

## Potential Use Cases

1. Visualizing key topics in a blog post or article.
2. Summarizing frequently used terms in a document.
3. Displaying popular tags or categories on a website.
4. Presenting survey results or feedback in a visually engaging manner.
