## How It Works

1. The WordCloud block processes the content provided in the table rows.
2. It splits the content by commas and counts the frequency of each word or phrase.
3. The most frequent words are displayed larger and more prominently in the cloud.
4. Less frequent words are displayed smaller and towards the edges of the cloud.
5. The block uses a predefined color palette to add visual variety to the words.

## Customization Options

- The block automatically filters out common words like "the", "and", "or", etc.
- You can customize the appearance by modifying the CSS classes in your project's stylesheet.
- The maximum number of displayed words is limited to 50 for optimal performance and readability.

## Potential Use Cases

1. Highlighting key topics on a blog's homepage
2. Summarizing the main themes of a conference or event
3. Visualizing customer feedback or survey responses
4. Displaying popular tags or categories in a content management system
5. Illustrating the main focus areas of a company or project
