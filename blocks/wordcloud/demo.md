This page demonstrates the WordCloud block, which generates a visually appealing word cloud based on the content provided.

## Basic Usage

| AEM, Franklin, Edge Delivery Services, Content, Authoring |
| Serverless, Performance, SEO, Accessibility, GitHub |
| JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Responsive Design, Mobile-First |

| AEM, Content, Performance, JavaScript, Blocks |
| Franklin, Edge Delivery Services, Serverless, GitHub |
| Responsive Design, Mobile-First, Accessibility, SEO |
| Components, Modules, Reusability, Scalability, Performance |

## How It Works

The WordCloud block processes the content provided in the rows above. Each word or phrase is analyzed for frequency, and the resulting word cloud displays words with varying sizes based on their occurrence. The most frequent words appear larger and bolder.

## Customization

The appearance of the word cloud can be customized by modifying the CSS. The current implementation uses a predefined color palette and applies random rotations to words for visual interest.

## Interactivity

- Hover over words to see them slightly increase in size and change opacity.
- Click on a word to display a tooltip showing its frequency count.

## Potential Use Cases

1. Summarizing key topics in an article or document
2. Visualizing frequently used terms in a project or domain
3. Creating engaging visual content for presentations or reports
4. Analyzing trends in user-generated content or feedback

## Accessibility Considerations

The WordCloud block is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring proper contrast ratios and providing context for screen readers.
