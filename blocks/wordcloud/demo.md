## How It Works

The WordCloud block processes the content within the table cells, counting the frequency of each word or phrase. It then generates a visually appealing word cloud where the size of each word corresponds to its frequency in the input data.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the word cloud by modifying the CSS variables in your project's styles. The block also supports responsiveness and accessibility features.

## Use Cases

- Visualizing key topics in a blog post or article
- Summarizing frequently used terms in a document
- Creating an engaging visual representation of a brand's key values or products
