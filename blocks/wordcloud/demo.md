# Word Cloud Demo

## Introduction

This demo showcases the Word Cloud block, a dynamic and visually appealing component for Franklin projects. The Word Cloud block generates a cloud of words based on the frequency of their occurrence in the provided text.

## Sample

## How It Works

The Word Cloud block processes the comma-separated words or phrases provided in the content. It then generates a visually appealing cloud where:

1. Words are displayed in varying font sizes based on their frequency.
2. More frequent words appear larger and are positioned more centrally.
3. Words are randomly rotated for visual interest.
4. A color palette is applied to add variety to the display.

## Customization Options

The Word Cloud block offers several customization options:

1. **Content**: Modify the words in the content area to change the displayed words.
2. **Colors**: The color palette can be adjusted in the CSS file.
3. **Size**: The overall size of the word cloud can be modified by changing the max-width in the CSS.
4. **Background**: The background can be customized by replacing the background image or modifying the CSS.

## Potential Use Cases

1. **Topic Visualization**: Highlight key topics or themes in a blog post or article.
2. **Skill Showcase**: Display a developer's or team's skill set.
3. **Tag Cloud**: Visualize popular tags or categories in a content management system.
4. **Concept Summary**: Summarize main concepts from a lecture or presentation.
5. **Feedback Analysis**: Visualize common terms from customer feedback or reviews.
