# WordCloud Demo

This page demonstrates the WordCloud block functionality in Franklin, visualizing common web development concepts and technologies.

## Basic Usage

Below is a simple example of the WordCloud block in action:

| WordCloud |
|-----------|
| franklin, adobe, edge, delivery, services, franklin, adobe |
| web, development, html, css, javascript, web, development |
| responsive, design, accessibility, performance, responsive |
| content, authoring, blocks, components, content, authoring |
| serverless, github, integration, modern, web, technologies |

## How It Works

The WordCloud block processes the comma-separated words in each row of the table. It then generates a visually appealing word cloud where:

1. More frequently used words appear larger.
2. Words are randomly rotated for visual interest.
3. A color palette is applied to add variety.

## Customization

Content authors can customize the word cloud by:

1. Adding or removing words from the list.
2. Repeating important words to increase their prominence.
3. Using phrases (e.g., "edge delivery") to keep concepts together.

## Interactivity

The generated word cloud is interactive:

- Hover over words to see them slightly enlarge.
- Click on a word to display its frequency count.

## Use Cases

The WordCloud block can be used for various purposes, such as:

1. Summarizing key topics of an article or webpage.
2. Visualizing frequently used terms in a document.
3. Creating an engaging visual representation of a brand's core values or services.
