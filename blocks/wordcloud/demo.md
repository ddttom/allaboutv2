# WordCloud Demo

## Introduction

This demo showcases the WordCloud block, a powerful visualization tool for Franklin projects. It generates a visually appealing word cloud based on the frequency of words or phrases in the provided content.

## Sample Table

| WordCloud |
|-----------|
| AEM, Franklin, Edge Delivery Services, content authoring, AEM |
| performance, scalability, serverless, GitHub integration, AEM |
| blocks, JavaScript, CSS, responsive design, Franklin |
| SEO, accessibility, mobile-first, modern web technologies, Edge Delivery Services |

## How It Works

The WordCloud block processes the content from the table above, counting the frequency of each word or phrase. It then generates a cloud where the size of each word is proportional to its frequency. The most common words appear larger and more prominently.

## Customization Options

1. Color Palette: The block uses a predefined set of colors, which can be customized in the CSS.
2. Font Size Range: Currently set from 14px to 48px, adjustable in the JavaScript.
3. Word Limit: The block displays up to 50 words, which can be modified for different densities.

## Potential Use Cases

1. Content Summary: Quickly visualize the main topics of a long article or document.
2. Keyword Analysis: Identify the most frequent terms in a dataset or corpus.
3. Tag Clouds: Display popular tags or categories in a visually engaging manner.
4. Concept Visualization: Illustrate the key concepts of a complex topic or field of study.
