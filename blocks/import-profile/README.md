# Import Profile Block

This block recreates the main profile section of the LinkedIn profile design.

## Usage

Include the Import Profile block in your Franklin document to display the user's profile information, including name, headline, location, and connection count.

## Authoring

The block expects the following content structure:

| import-profile |
| :---- |
| Name |
| Headline |
| Location |
| Connection count |

## Styling

The block uses CSS to style the profile section, including the cover image, profile picture, and profile information. Custom styles can be applied by modifying the `import-profile.css` file.

## Behavior

The JavaScript functionality creates the profile structure, including the cover image, profile picture, name, headline, location, connection count, and action buttons.

## Accessibility

- The profile picture includes an alt text for screen readers.
- Semantic HTML elements are used for proper structure and screen reader navigation.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Add functionality to the "Connect" and "Message" buttons.
2. Implement a way to customize the cover image through block parameters.
3. Add more profile sections (e.g., skills, education) to make the profile more comprehensive.
4. Implement responsive design for better display on smaller screens.
