# Teleprompter

This block creates a teleprompter functionality for displaying text content in a scrollable format.

## Usage

Add the teleprompter block to your page where you want the teleprompter functionality to be available.

## Authoring

No specific authoring is required in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. The teleprompter will use all text content on the page below the block.

## Styling

The teleprompter uses custom CSS classes for styling. You can customize the appearance by modifying the `teleprompter.css` file.

## Behavior

- Press the "Esc" key to start/stop the teleprompter.
- Use the mouse wheel to scroll through the text.
- Press the spacebar to pause/resume the timer.
- Text preceded by "note" will be displayed in light gray.

## Accessibility

- Keyboard controls are fully functional for start/stop and pause/resume actions.
- The teleprompter can be operated entirely using keyboard controls.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Add font size controls for better readability.
2. Implement adjustable scroll speed.
3. Add an option to change text and background colors.
4. Include a feature to import custom text files.
5. Implement a progress bar to show overall progress through the text.
