## Completed Tasks

* Analyzed the code-expander block's language detection functionality
* Identified the need to add JavaScript detection for lines starting with "//"
* Determined the optimal location for the new code in the detectLanguage function
* Updated the decision log with the implementation plan
* Updated the active context with the current focus and open questions
* Implemented JavaScript detection for lines starting with "//" in the code-expander block
* Added additional language detection patterns based on user feedback:
  * JavaScript detection for lines starting with "/*"
  * HTML detection for lines starting with "<link"
  * Shell detection for lines starting with a single "/"
* Updated all Memory Bank files with the latest changes

## Current Tasks

* Test the implementation with various code snippets
* Ensure that the changes don't interfere with other language detection logic

## Next Steps

* Consider adding detection for other common language patterns
* Evaluate if similar detection improvements could benefit other languages
* Document the changes in the code-expander block's documentation
* Consider adding unit tests for the language detection function
