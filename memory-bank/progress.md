## Completed Tasks

* Analyzed the code-expander block's language detection functionality
* Identified the need to add JavaScript detection for lines starting with "//"
* Determined the optimal location for the new code in the detectLanguage function
* Updated the decision log with the implementation plan
* Updated the active context with the current focus and open questions

## Current Tasks

* Implement the JavaScript detection for lines starting with "//" in the code-expander block
* Test the implementation with various code snippets
* Ensure that the change doesn't interfere with other language detection logic

## Next Steps

* Consider adding detection for other common JavaScript patterns
* Evaluate if similar detection improvements could benefit other languages
* Document the changes in the code-expander block's documentation
