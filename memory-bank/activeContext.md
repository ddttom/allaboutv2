## Current Focus

* Enhancing the code-expander block to detect JavaScript code when a line starts with "//"
* Improving language detection in the code-expander block for better syntax highlighting

## Recent Changes

* Added decision to implement JavaScript detection for lines starting with "//" in the code-expander block
* Documented the implementation approach in the decision log

## Open Questions/Issues

* Are there any other common JavaScript patterns that should be detected?
* Should we consider adding detection for other languages with similar comment patterns?
* Would it be beneficial to add a configuration option to customize language detection rules?
