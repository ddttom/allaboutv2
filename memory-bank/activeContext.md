## Current Focus

* Enhanced the code-expander block to detect programming languages based on common syntax patterns:
  * JavaScript detection for lines starting with "//" or "/*"
  * HTML detection for lines starting with "<link"
  * Shell detection for lines starting with a single "/"
  * CSS detection for lines starting with "." or "@"

## Recent Changes

* Added multiple language detection patterns to the code-expander block
* Updated the implementation approach in the decision log
* Enhanced system patterns documentation with the new comment-based language detection pattern

## Open Questions/Issues

* Are there any other common language patterns that should be detected?
* Should we consider adding detection for other languages with similar comment patterns?
* Would it be beneficial to add a configuration option to customize language detection rules?
* Should we consider adding unit tests for the language detection function to ensure reliability?
