## Decision

* Initialize Memory Bank to maintain project context and track development progress

## Rationale 

* A Memory Bank provides a structured way to document project context, decisions, and progress
* It helps maintain continuity across development sessions
* It serves as a reference for all team members to understand the project's evolution

## Implementation Details

* Created five core Memory Bank files:
  * productContext.md - High-level project overview
  * activeContext.md - Current status and focus
  * progress.md - Task tracking
  * decisionLog.md - Decision documentation
  * systemPatterns.md - Architectural patterns
* Each file follows a consistent format with timestamps for updates
