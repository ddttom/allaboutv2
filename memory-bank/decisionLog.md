## 2024-03-20: Enhanced Language Detection in code-expander Block

**Decision:** Enhance the code-expander block to detect programming languages based on common syntax patterns:
1. JavaScript detection for lines starting with "//" or "/*"
2. HTML detection for lines starting with "<link"
3. Shell detection for lines starting with a single "/"

**Rationale:**
- Improves language detection accuracy for various code snippets
- Many code examples start with language-specific syntax patterns that can be used for reliable detection
- These patterns are strong indicators of specific languages and should be detected early in the language detection process
- Better language detection leads to more accurate syntax highlighting

**Implementation:**
- Added checks in the `detectLanguage` function after the shebang checks but before the Python import checks
- Used simple and efficient pattern matching with `startsWith()` and regex where appropriate
- Returns the appropriate language immediately when a pattern is detected

**Implications:**
- Better syntax highlighting for code snippets with common language-specific patterns
- Improved user experience when viewing code in various languages
- Maintains compatibility with existing language detection logic
- Minimal code changes with high impact on functionality

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Adding the checks later in the detection flow, but this would have reduced their effectiveness
- Using more complex regex patterns for all checks, but simpler methods are more performant where possible
