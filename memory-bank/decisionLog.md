## 2024-03-20: Added JavaScript Detection for Lines Starting with "//"

**Decision:** Enhance the code-expander block to detect JavaScript code when a line starts with "//".

**Rationale:**
- Improves language detection accuracy for JavaScript code snippets
- Many JavaScript code examples start with comments using "//" syntax
- This pattern is a strong indicator of JavaScript code and should be detected early in the language detection process

**Implementation:**
- Added a check in the `detectLanguage` function after the shebang checks but before the Python import checks
- The check uses `firstLine.trim().startsWith('//')` to identify JavaScript comment syntax
- Returns 'javascript' immediately when this pattern is detected

**Implications:**
- Better syntax highlighting for JavaScript code snippets that start with comments
- Improved user experience when viewing JavaScript code
- Maintains compatibility with existing language detection logic
- Minimal code change with high impact on functionality

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Adding the check later in the detection flow, but this would have reduced its effectiveness
- Using a more complex regex pattern, but the simple startsWith check is more performant and sufficient for this case
