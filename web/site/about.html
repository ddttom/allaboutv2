      <h2>The Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Modern web design optimised for human users often fails for AI agents. This book examines why these patterns break agents — and demonstrates how fixing them benefits everyone. It's not about choosing between humans and AI; it's about building clearer, more accessible interfaces that serve both.
      </p>
      <p>
        The patterns that break AI agents also break humans. Toast notifications that vanish before anyone can read them. Pagination that hides content arbitrarily. Single-page applications with invisible state changes. These have been creating accessibility problems for years. Now AI agents are struggling with the same patterns, and there's commercial pressure to fix them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section data-section-type="author-background">
      <h2>The Author's Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Tom Cranstoun is a software consultant who has spent decades building web systems. Whilst working on identity delegation infrastructure, he noticed a recurring pattern: modern websites were beautifully designed for human users but completely opaque to AI agents trying to act on users' behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started as debugging frustration evolved into systematic research. Every pattern that broke agents turned out to be a pattern that also degraded human accessibility. Forms that validated only on submission. Error messages that disappeared after three seconds. Authentication states visible only through CSS styling. Visual-only feedback with no semantic markup.
      </p>
      <p>
        This book distils those learnings into practical guidance. Not theoretical frameworks, but production-ready patterns you can implement today.
      </p>
    </section>

    <div class="highlight-box" data-content-type="key-insight">
      <h3>Why This Matters Now</h3>
      <p>
        AI agents are no longer research projects. They're production systems making real purchases, booking actual appointments, and conducting business on behalf of users. When websites aren't designed for agent compatibility, agents fail — and users lose access to services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The commercial pressure to support agents creates an opportunity to fix accessibility problems that have existed for years. Better patterns for agents mean better experiences for everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Project Includes</h2>
      <p>MX-Bible is more than a book. It's an integrated set of resources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Book</strong> — 11 chapters (~57,000 words) examining the collision between modern web design and AI agents</li>
        <li><strong>10 Appendices</strong> — Freely accessible online with implementation cookbooks, battle-tested lessons, and real-world case studies</li>
        <li><strong>Web Audit Suite</strong> — A comprehensive Node.js tool implementing the patterns described in the book (available as separate purchase or professional service)</li>
        <li><strong>Code Examples</strong> — Production-ready implementations demonstrating AI-friendly patterns</li>
        <li><strong>Identity Delegation Project</strong> — Open-source infrastructure for portable agent authorisations</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section data-section-type="standards-approach">
      <h2>Standards-Based Approach</h2>
      <p>This book carefully distinguishes between established standards and proposed patterns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Established Standards</strong> — Schema.org, semantic HTML, ARIA (use with confidence)</li>
        <li><strong>Emerging Conventions</strong> — llms.txt from llmstxt.org (early adoption phase)</li>
        <li><strong>Proposed Patterns</strong> — ai-* meta tags, data-agent-visible (experimental, forward-compatible)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All proposed patterns are designed to be forward-compatible. They won't break anything if agents don't recognise them. Think of them as progressive enhancement for AI.
      </p>
