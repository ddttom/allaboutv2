    "**Issue:** \"I don't fit cleanly into any of these roles\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Issue:** \"This doc references another doc I can't find\"\n",
    "**Solution:** All docs live in `docs/for-ai/` directory. Check [index.md](docs/for-ai/index.md) for the complete catalog. Use your IDE's file search (Cmd/Ctrl+P) to find files quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue:** \"The documentation seems outdated\"\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Check the Recent Commits section at the bottom of the doc\n",
    "- Look for \"Last updated\" metadata\n",
    "- File an issue in the project repository\n",
    "- For EDS platform changes, check [aem.live](https://www.aem.live/) official docs\n",

    "- You may need to scroll manually\n",
    "- Try using the Table of Contents instead\n",
