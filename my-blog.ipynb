The key message: companies that thrive will use AI as a powerful assistant that enhances human capabilities whilst keeping people in control of the creative and strategic decisions that matter most., Rather than building systems that push humans aside, the blog advocates for human-centred AI that treats technology as a collaborative partner - one that processes data and suggests solutions while humans provide context, creativity, and final judgment calls.\n",
